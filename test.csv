 films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success   whether they re about superheroes   batman   superman   spawn     or geared toward kids   casper   or the arthouse crowd   ghost world     but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before    for starters   it was created by alan moore   and eddie campbell     who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid  8-1s with a 12 part series called the watchmen    to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd    the book   or   graphic novel     if you will   is over 5-1-1 pages long and includes nearly 3-1 more that consist of nothing but footnotes    in other words   don t dismiss this film because of its source    if you can get past the whole comic book thing   you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors   albert and allen hughes    getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in   well   anything   but riddle me this   who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society    the ghetto in question is   of course   whitechapel in 1888 london s east end    it s a filthy   sooty place where the whores   called   unfortunates     are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision    when the first stiff turns up   copper peter godley   robbie coltrane   the world is not enough   calls in inspector frederick abberline   johnny depp   blow   to crack the case    abberline   a widower   has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium    upon arriving in whitechapel   he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly   heather graham   say it isn t so   and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach    i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper   so i won t go into the particulars here   other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay    in the comic   they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper   but screenwriters terry hayes   vertical limit   and rafael yglesias   les mis   rables   do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end    it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because   after all   an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts    and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days     who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star          don t worry   it ll all make sense when you see it    now onto from hell s appearance   it s certainly dark and bleak enough   and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did   at times   it seems like sleepy hollow 2      the print i saw wasn t completely finished   both color and music had not been finalized   so no comments about marilyn manson     but cinematographer peter deming   don t say a word   ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks   even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic    oscar winner martin childs    shakespeare in love   production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place    even the acting in from hell is solid   with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent    ians holm   joe gould s secret   and richardson   1-12 dalmatians   log in great supporting roles   but the big surprise here is graham    i cringed the first time she opened her mouth   imagining her attempt at an irish accent   but it actually wasn t half bad    the film   however   is all good    2   -1-1   r for strong violence/gore   sexuality   language and drug content  ,1
 every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio   with every indication that it will be a stinker   and to everybody s surprise   perhaps even the studio   the film becomes a critical darling    mtv films   election   a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon   is a current example    did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened    the plot is deceptively simple    george washington carver high school is having student elections    tracy flick   reese witherspoon   is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question   way   way   high    mr     m     matthew broderick     sick of the megalomaniac student   encourages paul   a popular but slow jock to run    and paul s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well   for personal reasons    the dark side of such sleeper success is that   because expectations were so low going in   the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be    you can t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews   which is in contrast to the -1ative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have     election   a good film   does not live up to its hype    what makes  election  so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from  rushmore    released a few months earlier    the similarities are staggering    tracy flick    election    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    max fischer    rushmore    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    the most significant tension of  election  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    the most significant tension of  rushmore  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    tracy flick is from a single parent home   which has contributed to her drive    max fischer is from a single parent home   which has contributed to his drive    the male bumbling adult in  election    matthew broderick   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he even gets a bee sting    the male bumbling adult in  rushmore    bill murray   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he gets several bee stings    and so on    what happened    how is it that an individual screenplay    rushmore    and a novel    election    contain so many significant plot points   and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other   made from two different studios   from a genre   the high school geeks revenge movie   that hadn t been fully formed yet    even so   the strengths of  election  rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick   witherspoon   and newcomer jessica campbell   as paul s anti social sister   tammy    broderick here is playing the mr   rooney role from  ferris bueller    and he seems to be having the most fun he s had since then    witherspoon is a revelation    it s early in the year   it s a comedy   and teenagers have little clout   but for my money   witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination    and once campbell s character gets going   like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium   then you re won over    one thing that s been bothering me since i ve seen it    there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film    i sup1e that   coming from mtv films   i should expect no less        but the film starts off light and airy   like a sitcom    as the screws tighten   and the tensions mount   alexander payne decides to add elements that   frankly   distract from the story    it is bad enough that mr   m doesn t like tracy s determination to win at all costs   but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship    even so   there s no logical reason why mr   m has an affair when he does    there s a lot to like in  election    but the plot similarities to  rushmore    and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven   mark this as a disappointment    ,1
 you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to    in order to make the film a success   all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars   have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits    no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body   it s basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner   only adding a few modern twists      essentially   it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking    it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy   not to mention very manipulative    but oh   how enjoyable that manipulation is    but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does   because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming   sleepless in seattle    it couldn t have been the directing   because both films were helmed by the same woman    i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail   but then again   is that really important    if you like something so much   why even question it    again   the storyline is as cliched as they come    tom hanks plays joe fox   the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley   the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run children s book shop called   in a nice homage   the shop around the corner    fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business    little do they know   they are already in love with each other over the internet   only neither party knows the other person s true identity    the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen    sure   there are some mildly interesting subplots   but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship    all of this   of course   leads up to the predictable climax    but as foreseeable as the ending is   it s so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does    when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love   i was filled with such   for lack of a better word   happiness that for the first time all year   i actually left the theater smiling    ,1
    jaws   is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen    the movie opens with blackness   and only distant   alien like underwater sounds    then it comes   the first ominous bars of com1er john williams  now infamous score    dah dum    from there   director steven spielberg wastes no time   taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly    right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean   and once   jaws   has attacked   it never relinquishes its grip    perhaps what is most outstanding about   jaws   is how spielberg builds the movie    he works it like a theatrical production   with a first act and a second act    unlike so many modern filmmakers   he has a great deal of restraint   and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act    until then   he merely suggests its presence with creepy   subjective underwater shots and williams  music    he s building the tension bit by bit   so when it comes time for the climax   the shark s arrival is truly terrifying    he doesn t let us get bored with the imagery    the first act opens with police chief martin brody   roy scheider     a new york cop who has taken an easy   peaceful job running the police station on amity island   a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years    the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july   and the mayor   larry vaughn   murray hamilton     doesn t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money    brody is joined by matt hooper   richard dreyfuss     a young   ambitious shark expert from the marine institute    hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it    his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark     it s a perfect engine   an eating machine     make it that much more terrifying    when vaughn finally relents   hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint   robert shaw   on his decrepit boat   the orca   to search for the shark    the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark   and inevitably   are hunted by it       jaws   is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing   tension   and horror    it is like ten movies all rolled into one   and it s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975   taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time   until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by   star wars        even today   fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock s   psycho     and it never seems to age    although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences   including several mechanical sharks   obsolete   none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill    the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing   characterization   sharp editing   and creative photography   instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects    scheider   dreyfuss   and shaw were known actors at the time   jaws   was made   but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman    nevertheless   this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark    scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what s right and going against the entire town       it s your first summer here   you know     mayor vaughn warns him    dreyfuss   who had previously been seen in   american graffiti     1973   and   the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz     1974   gives a surprisingly mature   complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers    however   most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie s captain ahab   a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards    bordering of parody   shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism    he s slightly deranged   and shaw s performance is almost a caricature    however   there is one scene late in the film   when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars    quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u   s   s    indianapolis   a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese    his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1   -1-1-1 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen    shaw delivers the story in one long take   and it is the best acting in the film    of course   we can t leave out the shark itself   with its black eyes   endless rows of teeth   and insatiable urge to eat   it is basically the epitome of all mankind s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature    a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real    having survived sinch the dinosaurs   great whites do exist   they can be as large as the shark in   jaws     and they are a threat    every one of spielberg s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark   a bunch of writihing   dangling   completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into    the shark in   jaws   was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks   all nicknamed   bruce   by the crew   built to be shot from different angles    many have forgotten   but   jaws   was a sort of precursor to   waterworld     1995     a movie s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb    but   as we can see now   spielberg overcame all the obstacles   and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood    ,1
 moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the 1t salary cap era    you ve got to know how to allocate your resources    every dollar spent on a free agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers    in the nfl   this leads to teams like the detroit lions   who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract   but can only field five guys named herb to block for him    in the movies   you end up with films like   spawn     with a huge special effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors    jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking    he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line    watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid   fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars   is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit   except that sanders doesn t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages    but like the lions star   jackie doesn t have anybody to block for him    almost every cent that s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts   and as chan does his own stunts   the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills    this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors   chan directs     scripts and dubbing and supporting characters   not to mention the hideous title sequence    this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain       chan s first release in this country     rumble in the bronx     was sup1edly set in new york   but was filmed in vancouver   and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible      heck   jackie doesn t even have enough money for a haircut   looks like   much less a personal hairstylist    in condor   chan plays the same character he s always played   himself   a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen   a master of both kung fu and slapstick fu    jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert   and is chased by a horde of neo nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs   one of the things i like about jackie chan movies   no political correctness      he is joined by three women   who have little to do except scream     jackie   save us !     and misuse firearms    the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere   and he s more pathetic than evil    en route   we have an extended motorcycle chase scene   a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo nazis   and two confrontations with savage natives    once at the secret desert base   there is a long chop socky sequence   followed by the film s centerpiece   a wind tunnel fight that s even better than the one in face/off    this is where the money was spent   on well choreographed kung fu sequences   on giant kevlar hamster balls   on smashed up crates of bananas   and on scorpions    ignore the gaping holes in the plot   how   exactly   if the villain s legs were broken   did he escape from the secret nazi base   and why didn t he take the key with him        don t worry about the production values   or what   exactly   the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara    just go see the movie    operation condor has pretentions of being a   raiders of the lost ark   knockoff   but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him    with a lawrence kazdan screenplay   a john williams score   spielberg directing and george lucas producing   condor might be an a+ movie    however   you ve got to go with what you ve got   and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special    a talent that mainstream hollywood should   could   and ought to utilize    ,1
 on june 3-1   196-1   a self taught   idealistic   yet pragmatic   young man became   at age 36   the first head of government of a newly independent african state   formerly the belgian congo    two months later   he was ousted from his powerful 1ition and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides    this little known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in   lumumba      patrice lumumba s   eriq ebouaney   story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary     lumumba   death of a prophet     virtually guaranteeing that his new   fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject    peck   with co writer pascal bonitzer   begins at the end of the story of the young political leader    we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men    images of hatchets   saws and fast emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image    jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian owned congo    a third class 1tal worker   lumumba   speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes   proclaiming himself not tribal   not regional   but a national leader    his small   mobile party   the congolese national movement   mnc   is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer   and get his face known   in the bustling capital   stanleyville    at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world   lumumba is in the right place at the right time and   through political savvy and chess like manipulation   achieves a 1ition of leadership of the mnc    as the date for independence approaches   he tactically 1itions himself to be the new nation s first prime minister and defense minister   supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu   maka kotto      the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country s vast natural resources of copper   diamonds   gold and more    lumumba won t seek the help of the us   knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government    his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination    the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies   the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves   belgian troops violently intervene   the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe   pascal nzonzi   and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad    this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries    peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba   his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 5-1 s and 6-1 s       during the time the story takes place   many new nations   including nigeria and somalia   were born   with varying degrees of success and failure   usually dependent upon which country colonized them    some colonial masters were better than others      the effort involved in   lumumba   is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades   if at all    production values are first rate on what must be a small   by us standards   budget    the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique    the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba s life    the political side of things is evenly told in a linear   straightforward manner that teaches   not preaches    it concentrates on the good deeds of the man   if a bit as a stalwart saint   but doesn t embellish on a larger than life persona    the family side of patrice s life is handled in several   perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children   embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child    i know the intent is to flesh the man out   but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba    the story   as such   has a lopsided feel about it    high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character    the actor gives a convincing   charismatic performance as the multifaceted   politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions    in true docudrama tradition   the supporting cast does not outshine the star   complementing his good efforts   instead       lumumba   is a solid   interesting   educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos   both    it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a

 apparently   director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film   american history x   i don t know the details of the fight   but it seems that he is not happy with the final product   and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether    i ve heard about this kind of thing happening before   and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce    as it is   i found american history x to be an extremely good film   not just because of tony kaye s focused look at the touchy subject of racism   but because of a powerful   charismatic performance from edward norton    it s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton s fantastic role in primal fear   but   here he is now   starring in his own film and making himself a star    norton is one of those performers who becomes his character   and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year    he plays a young man named derek vinyard   a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother   danny   edward furlong     mother   beverly d angelo     and sister   davin   jennifer lien      the film opens with a flashback   in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car    we find out that this lands him in prison   and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny    in the present time of the film   danny is in high school   and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother    much of the film is told in flashback   and we see the path that leads to derek s adoption of white supremacy    when derek is released   having served three years in prison   he finds that his brother is now a full blown skinhead   derek   however   has given up the violence   and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things    what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid   thoughtless people    they are intelligent and articulate   and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms    it s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach   but kaye has found the right note for his material    because american history x is a mainstream film   there has to be a redemption phase for our main character    some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic    i partially disagree with this   because   although i do not advocate racism in any way   it s interesting the way kaye presents derek    he is a loud   obnoxious man   but he s also very smart    the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable    his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men    it s clear that he s passionate about his beliefs   and that he s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up    of course   it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part    it s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest    in addition to getting the look just right   he s perfect for this role    derek requires intelligence   depth   and a whole lot of shouting   and norton does it all with ease    even when he s at his meanest   derek has a likable quality to him   and that s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead    what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny s school   avery brooks   becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny    the other performances are all terrific   with standouts from furlong   d angelo   and lien    visually   the film is very powerful    kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices   and most of them work nicely    lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere    but   like a lot of movies lately   american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes    although the climactic scene is very moving   the picture ends with a pretentious   preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed    for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point   it felt like a slap in the face to be hand fed a theme in such a simplistic way    it makes me wonder what   exactly   tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film    perhaps this last scene was the problem    it s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good    in a time when so many movies are timid and weak   american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way    ,1
 one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy s wedding    and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it    her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald   who hasn t made a worthwhile film since 1986    but the fact is   betsy s wedding is also an alan alda film    and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years   alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects   including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life    written and directed by alda   betsy s wedding is a vibrant slice of life   mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor    alda s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing  and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare    as bride and groom   molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film   but they are by far the least interesting    walsh is a nonentity   with all the screen presence of a door knob    ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain    she looks hideous with her short cropped orange hair   red lip stick and grotesque outfits    she s sup1ed to be a dress designer   but she looks more like a clown    and to make matters worse   ringwald s performance matches her appearance    thankfully   alda keeps ringwald s screen time to a minimum   he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters    the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride s working class   italian family and the groom s rich   gentile family    ringwald s folks are homey and down to earth   with alda as her free spirited father   madeline kahn as her practical mother   and ally sheedy as her lonely sister    walsh s clan   on the other hand   is prim   proper and ostentatious    when the two families meet and mingle   the movie becomes a story of culture clash   or as one character puts it     money versus values      ally sheedy   in a wonderfully understated performance   is one of the film s most pleasant surprises    sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body    it s anthony lapaglia   however   who seizes the spotlight    lapaglia plays stevie dee   a suave   overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry    lapaglia s sincere but dim witted character is a riot    and what s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro   with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure    lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting   and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role model and partly a rip off    i don t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re born   but i do know that lapaglia s over the top performance should not be missed    the scrumptious comic acting   however   extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia    joe pesci   in particular   sinks his teeth into his role as alda s unscrupulous brother in law   a slum lord with mob ties   who is cheating on his wife   catherine o hara      alda   faced with challenge of both directing and acting   somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride s financially strapped father   a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet    the film adopts alda s psychological point of view as he tries to one   plan the wedding   and two   pay for it    as a filmmaker   alda s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful    and while he doesn t have the comic genius of a woody allen   alda does 1sess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy    ,1

 the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire fu copycats    it s not a pretty death   and it s leaving the likes of schwartznager   stallone   and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea    sometimes   the mix results in a mind blowing spectacle unlike any other    quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work   as in 1999 s the matrix   can be a real gem    but too often hollywood gets it wrong   even when they pay off chinese directors    flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists    mostly it s laughable    in hollywood s rush to emulate the success of the matrix   trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form    but iron monkey   the latest asian import   shows us how to get it right    iron monkey   actually a reissue of a 1993 film   is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante   rongguang yu     fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry    but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei hong   most recently seen in one of the most overlooked   and 1sibly best films of 2-1-1-1   drunken master 2   released in the u   s   as the legend of drunken master      unlike drunken master 2   which stars jackie chan as an adult fei hong   iron monkey finds a much younger fei hong   sze man tsang   and his father wong kei ying   yen chi dan   thrust into the middle of iron monkey s fight against oppression    iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2   at times   fighting styles   especially that of monkey himself   do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle toed floating of films like crouching tiger   hidden dragon   director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth    iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore   kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger    however   there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters   such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good hearted but misguided enemy   chief fox    in those moments   and in others   iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience    while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2   iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune    aka siunin wong fei hung tsi titmalau    ,1
 after watching   rat race   last week   i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that   when not laughing aloud   i had held a grin for virtually all of the film s 112 minutes    saturday night   i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn t enjoy it as much the second time as the first       rat race   is a great goofy delight   a dandy mix of energetic performances   inspired sight gags and flat out silliness    hands down   this is the most fun film of the summer    the movie begins with zippy retro style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a  6-1s slapstick comedy   featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky jerky bodies bounding around the screen    then comes the setup    donald sinclair   john cleese     the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas   enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients    to that end   he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines    gathering together the lucky token holders   he explains     today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six      the competition is simple   each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city   n   m     containing $2 million in cash    there is a transmitter in every key   so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead    the race has no rules   whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money    since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes   let s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers    decked out in flashy   trashy clothing and sporting big hair   vera baker   whoopi goldberg   is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby    she finds that grown up merrill   lanai chapman   is erudite   conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life    thrown together   it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature    owen templeton   cuba gooding jr     is currently the most hated man in america    an nfl referee   he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high profile game    after escaping from a vengeful cab driver   owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention    mr   pollini   rowan atkinson   is a cheerful   odd little italian man on holiday in america    he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times    pollini hitches a ride with zack   wayne knight     a hyper tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation    randy pear   jon lovitz   promised his wife beverly   kathy najimy   and two kids a fun filled vacation in las vegas    fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race   he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview    beverly insists the family stay together   so they hop in the mini van and tear off into the desert    brothers duane   seth green   and blaine   vince vieluf   cody are young   crooked and stupid    blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self done tongue piercing   and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him    the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal    finally   nick shaffer   breckin meyer   is a no nonsense lawyer in training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet   amy smart   for the journey    at first glance   they seem blandly wholesome   but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn   dean cain   and spies him swimming with another woman    director jerry zucker     airplane       ghost     leaps from racer to racer   periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr   grisham   dave thomas     his personality impaired right hand man   continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers    as with any zucker production   a few jokes fall flat   but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps    high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally   with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay off    had i been part of the filmmaking team   i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron    it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm inducing hint of child molestation    i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence    my god   do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing   all star      but enough carping       rat race   is a riot   with terrific no holds barred performances from the diverse cast    see it   see it again and when the dvd comes out   buy it   because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for    ,1
 i ve noticed something lately that i ve never thought of before    pseudo  substance   hollywood faking deep meanings in their films    have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed   then when you look back   you realize there was something missing    more and more   filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed   melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film   but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience   you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff    i m not trying to say city of angels is that bad    it had a lot going for it   but somewhere along the way   it faltered    somehow   underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all   there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography    the predictable ending that shattered our hopes   even though we saw it coming   only added to the disappointment    but for over an hour   city of angels is well worth the time    nicolas cage is seth   a guardian angel who   like hundreds   likely thousands or even millions   of other angels   spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality   humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life    meg ryan   in her most subdued performance yet   plays maggie   a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive    after losing a patient on the surgery table   these questions envelope maggie   and seth   the angel who was there to oversee the patient s transition into the afterlife   is immediately captivated by the doctor    he begins following and observing maggie   falling more and more in love with her everyday    angels   who we quickly learn are not and never were humans   can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch   but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire    seth s adoration is too much to resist   and eventually he does appear to maggie   quite regularly   although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community    the angels are interestingly presented   all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities   but it s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness    cage is a wonderfully versatile actor   think face/off   raising arizona   and it could happen to you   what a combo !   who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once    it s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire    the two aren t very comparable to each other   but they both deviate from her usual   intelligently ditzy   romantic comedy roles   and it s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy    but even though the two leads do an impressive job   it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye    it s a shame that with so much going for it   city of angels falters so much in its final stages   leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there   they just didn t know quite how to get to it    they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high    filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on   remember   and convey to others thru word of mouth   so after telling us for 6-1+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece   they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths    based on the german film wings of desire   that being the english title   of course     city of angels is ninety percent success   enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings   even the devastatingly disappointing ending    most movie goers   the non cynics anyway   will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized    nonetheless   city of angels is beautifully captivating   which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories    ,1

 the police -1otiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do    lives are often at stake   and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable   prone to turn on the -1otiator at a moment s notice    the -1otiator must therefore be something of an actor   psychologist   and sham artist   in addition to being a police officer   he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence   or failing that   must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower    most of all   the -1otiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as 1sible   and quickly gain control of the situation   dominate the conversation   and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants    it takes a pretty smart person to do that    but what if the hostage holding criminal is just as smart    what if he s also able to think on his feet    in fact   what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor    it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f   gary gray s the -1otiator    in this film   police -1otiator danny roman   samuel l   jackson   is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force    when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman s home   roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder    faced with the scorn of most of the police department   and under close scrutiny by the media   roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain s office    i don t quite remember if the captain actually said     i hate to do this   but            although it wouldn t surprise me if he did    luckily   the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above    after being offered a take it or leave it deal by the district attorney   roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum   j   t    walsh     taking him and others hostage   and proclaiming he has been framed    although roman s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up   gray redeems himself by involving us with the -1otiations between roman and fellow police -1otiator chris sabian   kevin spacey   which soon ensue    jackson   while a superb actor   is miscast in the role of roman    the actor has become so popular   and so often identified as a protagonist   notable exceptions can be found   such as in jackie brown     that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats    the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence    how can we believe he s going to shoot a hostage   no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier    unfortunately   this preconception saps the film of some of it s would be suspenseful moments   and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson s acting ability    almost every time he s in a scene   jackson steals it without looking back    when spacey appears   the film has already run about a third of its course    his is an interesting character    made out to be some kind of -1otiating superman   our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation       i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower   but i can t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone     he says    when he gets the call to action   however   he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be    soon   his character has to -1otiate not only with roman   but also with the swat commander   david morse   who is itching to send in a team to take roman out   all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation   should -1otiations fail    this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the -1otiator and spacey the actor    as the second protagonist   spacey measures up nicely    gray really lucked out with this cast    david morse as commander beck   ron rifkin as commander frost   and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent   and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey    the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices   morse played a similar role in the rock   rifkin played the d   a    in l   a   confidential   and spencer played a police detective in cop land    with the level of acting   however   this can be forgiven    also in the supporting cast   paul giamatti as rudy   one of the hostages   is notable for the comic relief he provides    his character is initially so slimy   and giamatti himself just looks so shifty   that you expect to laugh before he even says anything    fortunately   this doesn t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film   but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout    j   t   walsh   as the suspicious internal affairs inspector   clocks in with one of his final performances    sadly   the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year   and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film    walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam   backdraft   and nixon    for one of his best performances   check out sling blade   in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton    when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march   walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success   the actors performed together in a few good men      the -1otiator is actually dedicated to walsh   and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role   it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing    in the end   the -1otiator has a plotline that parallels it s reality    we re served with the premise that two equally deft -1otiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best    as an audience   we re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie   and we d like to see if one will dominate the film    both provide some pretty good entertainment    ,1
 plot   a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon   to whom he s devoted a tribute band in which he sings   gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place    critique   i m a sucker for movies like this    a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams   works hard   devotes the time   the energy and the patience   and ultimately hits it big time    in the case of this film   our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it   yup   luck always finds its way into these types of equations   although generally tied very closely to hard work     they need a new singer    his entry and adaptation to the whole   rock  n roll   lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch    although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love   or past love   of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it    metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn t that prominent anymore   i still check out my motley crue   twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again    that s not to say that you won t like this film if you don t like the music   but the music and live performances from the band   play a big part in the movie   and i for one   had a blast watching and listening to it all    but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg    wow   hand this fella some major props   as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god   incidentally   metal god was the film s original title   and a much better one if you ask me      he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through    he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic   who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams    aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend   and the romance angle between them was sweet     but she didn t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes    i was also impressed by some of the   real   musicians who played in the film   zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne   jeff pilson from dokken   stephan jenkins from third eye blind   blas elias from slaughter     but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members    it s to note that this film was based on a real life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer   their original singer also admitted to being gay   as in this film      just for the record   i m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements   since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies   but because it s a fun   uplifting   well paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances    oh yeah   and for those who dig the   heavier   side of music   the soundtrack also rocks ! !  you see       dreams  can come true        where s joblo coming from    almost famous   8/1-1     blow   8/1-1     boogie nights   9/1-1     detroit rock city   8/1-1     girlfight   6/1-1     goodfellas   1-1/1-1    ,1
 carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion    made in 1972   it still features most of the regulars of this genre    sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit   kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting   head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac   hattie jacques re takes her role as matron   and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr   goode    the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs   with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard    this time   williams is after matron   jacques   when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr   goode    the doctor   hawtrey   is sworn to secrecy       i assure you   that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other !    bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself    there are great cameos from joan sims   an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene   and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he s at work   at the railway station      sid james  gang including cyril his son   kenneth cope   try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home    he has to share a room with nurse ball   barbara windsor   and she soon sees through him !  the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital s pills with panic ensuing    there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron   however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous  matron s     williams is   as usual   on top form   but sid james isn t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all    the same does not go for charles hawtrey   for although he only first appears in the movie after 3-1 minutes gone and has scarce screen time   he seems to steal every scene he is in    by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor s talent to full effect   the film seems to flounder   but it certainly makes up for it with it s good storyline and it s other appealing characters    this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !  ,1
 the ultimate match up between good and evil     the untouchables   is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry    based on the 1959 television show of the same title     the untouchables   may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place   but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences   some excellent acting   a memorable score   and a clever script    the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public    elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the im1sible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order    however   as ness soon learns   in order to stabilize peace   you have to bend a few laws    the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes    the film begins with capone   played perfectly by deniro   declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws    the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl    from this point we know capone is evil   not only because he kills without hesitation   but also because he is a lying bastard    right from the first five minutes of the film   de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs    this developed hatred is before the film s hero   ness   is even introduced    i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone    the film only gets better from this point    with the formation of the untouchables   there is a group of men wearing long   dark overcoats and hats    they walk in unison and they only look forward    as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens    holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals   this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films    one that comes to mind is   the matrix   when neo   morpheus   trinity   and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world    wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 193-1 s style   the similarities between these two are countless       the untouchables   has some of the hippest   bravest heroes in any action film    the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone s army    each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others    elliot ness   played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner   is a character that surely grows during the course of the film    he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be    however   as the film develops so does ness    his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side    he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends    his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in    sean connery   who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role   plays malone   an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables    malone acts as a mentor to ness    he teaches him   the chicago way   to do things   when they attack with a knife   you attack with a gun    connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed    andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone   a young man who is just becoming a police officer    as ness grows   he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him    charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone    smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film    the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen    also very similar to   the matrix     they are exciting and intense    >from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps   the scenes are well thought out and well executed    the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement    its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors    the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective    although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified   this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting   great directing   and great action    some scenes   capone and the baseball bat   the train station   have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid    ,1
 having not seen     who framed roger rabbit   in over 1-1 years   and not remembering much besides that i liked it then   i decided to rent it recently    watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is    aside from the fact that it s a milestone in animation in movies   it s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters   have them interact   and make it convincingly real   and a great entertainment it s also quite an effective comedy/mystery    while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original   especially baby herman   and watching them together is a lot of fun    the story begins in hollywood in 1947    cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work   so hard boiled private detective eddie valiant   bob hoskins   is called in by studio head r   k    maroon   alan tilvern   to try to help get roger s mind back on work    maroon thinks that roger s wife   jessica s   1sible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots    valiant takes some photos of jessica playing   `patty cake  with marvin acme   stubby kaye     the owner of toontown   where all of the cartoon characters live   and takes them to maroon    upon seeing them   roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect    the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town   and eventually toontown   trying to clear roger s good name    along the way they meet judge doom   christopher lloyd   a judge jury and executioner type who s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon      `who framed roger rabbit  won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters   williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in      director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production   which included hundreds of animators    also bob hoskins  performance should be credited    he   in addition to the rest of the human cast   finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co stars    according to the internet movie database   hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off    `who framed roger rabbit  is a rare film    one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family   although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom      do yourself a favor and rent it   `p p p p please      ,1
 there s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days    stiller currently has three projects in circulation   and what other actor can lay claim to that    he s in   there s something about mary     which i * still * haven t seen    and he s in the acerbic   your friends & neighbors     playing a talkative   sexually frustrated drama coach called jerri    now there s   permanent midnight     in which stiller plays another jerry   this one a heroin addicted television writer   last name stahl    there s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug addiction pictures the minute they ve proved themselves commercially    ewan mcgregor springs to mind who   after successful turns in   emma   and   brassed off     received greater respect and admiration for his mind blowing realization as renton in danny boyle s transatlantic junk fest     trainspotting      the philosophy appears to be a simple one   if you want  em to be taken seriously   make  em do drugs       permanent midnight   is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl   a successful hollywood writer who   in the mid eighties   had a $5   -1-1-1 a week job churning out plotlines for dis1able tv sitcoms and a $6   -1-1-1 a week heroin habit    a habit   in stahl s own words     the size of utah      as stahl   stiller contributes a commanding performance    unlike   trainspotting     which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse     permanent midnight   instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance    one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to   naked lunch   author william s   burroughs who   when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds     so i can shave      stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in   permanent midnight     it s so he can talk to his mother on the phone   show up for work on time   even pay his bills    while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl   the writing   adapted from stahl s autobiography by director david veloz   is controlled and pointed       permanent midnight   shows how stahl moved from new york to l   a   to  again in the author s words     escape the drug scene     yeah   right     why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec   elizabeth hurley   so im1sibly polite you d swear her single profanity was dubbed     and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings    stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty   norristown s own maria bello   with whom he spent some rehab time    janeane garofalo is wasted  and miscast  as a heavily bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped up wordsmith   and that s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor    stiller   unshaven   burroughs take note   and with lots of mascara around the eyes   has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but   to his credit   never once pushes his pill popping   needle jabbing performance over the top    the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see   permanent midnight     a dark   comic   and strangely absorbing study of assisted living    ,1
 by phil curtolo mel gibson   braveheart   gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard s ransom    gibson plays tom mullen   a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath   played by gary sinise   forrest gump     and his band of low life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million    tom and his wife   kate   played by rene russo   tin cup   were instructed not to inform the police   but they contacted the fbi    minutes later   an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo   broken arrow   are in tom s house and wiring every phone    the plot sounds average   just like most other kidnap movies that you ve already seen   and it was nothing more than that    that is until about half way through the movie    suddenly   tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying     this is your ransom    but this is as close as you will ever get to it    instead   i am offering this money as a reward on your head   dead or alive      at this point   the plot thickened   and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense filled action film with great stunts    the last half of the film is very well done    another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise   as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie    owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject     it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones      before this movie   sinise played mostly   good guys     first in of mice & men   then in forrest gump   and most recently   in apollo 13    but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop gone bad    gibson   of course   was just being gibson   in an oscar worthy performance    although most of the scenes were quite predictable   ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film        ,1
 one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction    the pur1e of star trek is to provide flashy   innocent fun    sometimes the stories are compelling    sometimes they re not    but   with the exception of the first film in the series   which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces     i ve never been bored by any of the enterprise s numerous missions    star trek   insurrection is no exception    the film has gotten some -1ative reviews   a friend of mine actually thinks it s the worst in the series     but i m not really sure why    it s an exciting   often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film    some say it s a bit too light   and more of a long episode than a film    others say the special effects are cheesy and that it s boring    i simply enjoyed the film    insurrection   which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast   introduces us to a race of people called the ba ku   the ba ku are very old   most of them are about three hundred years old     but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet    of course   these peaceful people can t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves   leave it up to their archenemies   the son a   led by ru afo   f    murray abraham     to mess everything up    the son a   who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable   strike a deal with the federation to move the ba ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying    that s when captain picard   patrick stewart   steps in   he realizes that moving the ba ku would kill them   it also helps that he falls in love with a ba ku woman   donna murphy        so   with his trusty crew   picard defies the federation to keep the ba ku in their natural habitat    when dealing with a series with as much history as this   it s not entirely necessary to re introduce your characters with each episode    this is why i believe non fans have a hard time getting into star trek   in order to enjoy it   one has to understand how to approach it    insurrection   however   does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters    stewart is bold as always   a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together    jonathan frakes   who also directed   is funny as commander riker   a subplot with data   brent spiner   discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting   and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain   overacting like crazy    frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact   insurrection is an exciting film   with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action    this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation   and the result is very pleasing to the eye   particularly in the climactic scenes   in which the son a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba ku planet   the special effects have a clean   impressively sharp look    if i have any complaint about the film   it s that it tries to take a moral stance when it s not very appropriate to do so    i don t think it s that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 6-1-1 ba ku in order to save the lives of thousands    better yet   why couldn t they have co existed    insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience    with it s inherent camp factor   the star trek series doesn t seem well equipped to deal with issues like this    i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle    ,1
 a fully loaded entertainment review   website coming in july !  >from ace ventura to truman burbank   jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic   yet sympathetic   characters    1996 s the cable guy was sup1ed to be his big   breakthrough   role from zany humor into darker   more dramatic acting    as most everyone knows   the results were   well   less than stellar    not only did the film not do so hot at the box office   but it was also panned by critics    as far as i know   gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it    the first time i saw the cable guy   in theatres   i was in super critic mode   and didn t really like it    however   due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day   i ve had time to lean back   relax   and take in the film    and to my surprise   it grew on me    the plot is rather simple   broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy   played by carrey   then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship    see   steven s been having some problems with his girlfriend   robin   leslie mann     and he doesn t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend    also   some of the cable guy s antics have been creeping him out    carrey   as the cable guy   gives steven various aliases   which later we find out are all tv characters   larry tate   chip douglas   ricky ricardo   etc   he apparently lives in his cable van   and while many critics didn t enjoy this newer   darker   less manic performance from carrey   i thought it was interesting and rather well done    for me   its not the movie as a whole that s enjoyable   but rather several individual scenes   a karaoke jam at steven s apartment   a medieval fight at a theme restaurant   and a bathroom beating   a la liar   liar     just to name a few    perhaps the fact that more of carrey s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny    and if you really want to see something   you ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane s   somebody to love     sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam    the cable guy has its bad spots   like most any movie    i didn t particularly like steven s girlfriend   and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend    also   the ending   while having you fooled for a moment   is rather contrived   and somewhat dissapointing    still   i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture   if you re at the video store and can t think of anything to rent   i suggest you try it out    or if you have hbo   just wait till it comes on   you won t have to wait long      hell   that s what i do every day    ,1
 when bulworth ended   i allowed myself a sigh of relief     it is 1sible for me to enjoy political satire      there have been several recent political films that didn t do a whole lot for me    wag the dog   for instance   i found to be an intelligent but heartless film   while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness      bulworth is a far better film than these   both in its execution and lasting impression      it s a tremendously funny and intelligent picture   but it also has an emotional center    writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character   and   in turn   we like him and actually care about the story        beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth   the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again      he hasn t slept in days   nor has he eaten   and   almost instantaneously   he goes insane       he s not stark raving mad   not outright   anyway     but he s definitely bonkers       it s the final weekend of his campaign   and his assistant   murphy   oliver platt   has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto       bulworth begins the speech   but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest         you mean     one lady asks     the democratic party doesn t care about the african american community           well     he shouts   laughing     isn t that obvious      the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life   he muses later that it s a bad thing to make decisions when you re suicidal     he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses   graham beckel   whom he believes to be the hitman       bulworth also meets nina   halle berry   with whom he becomes infatuated       suddenly   in the short span of this weekend   bulworth s no nonsense   truth in politics   methods become a national sensation   and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences    beatty s work on both sides of the camera is excellent      his script and direction are both extremely sharp   as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself      here is a man who s reached his limit   and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure      i like that the film doesn t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations   but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich   although the anti rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film        some of the segments are simply hilarious   such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him      much of the film is completely absurd   but that s the fun part about it      it s an angry   serious film at the core   but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre      what adds to this feeling is beatty s portrayal of bulworth   this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale       beatty is so much fun to watch here    he s always funny   but he s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions       beatty is so good that bulworth   despite his shortcomings as a human being   is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning    the supporting cast is vast and colorful      berry is luminous   as always   and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles      don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun toting toddlers to do his dirty work      oliver platt is an actor who should be careful   for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting   though he s very funny to watch       paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections    is bulworth offensive      i sup1e some may see it that way      i wasn t offended by the film   but then again   i hardly care about politics      i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story      the film isn t perfect   of course    the ending didn t quite work for me   and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced   although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic        but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film      bulworth is a smart   uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface      ,1
 call 911 for the cliche police if you must   but the eyes are the window to the soul    the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze   paul newman   ralph fiennes   anthony hopkins   morgan freeman    you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds   that the characters they play are real human beings    we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor   but he had that unique quality in his eyes    in gridlock d   an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire   shakur and his co star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry    shakur

entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie   they are going to government offices on new year s day   in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all    gridlock d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey   1991 s falling down   which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles    in falling down   michael douglas  d fens   the character s personalized license plate   echoed in gridlock d by the drug lord d reper s plates   whips out a gun because he can t get breakfast at mcdonald s   in gridlock d   spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center    and where the unhinged d fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences   writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation    one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question     do you expect the world to stop       just  because you picked  today  to clean up      the world in gridlock d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down   but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time    hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system   but perhaps not enough of them    a significant chunk of gridlock d is devoted to spoon and stretch s flight from d reper and from the police   and those sub plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments    in one scene   stretch scares off d reper by getting chummy with a police officer   another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures    the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running   while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time    hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film s main events   perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self destructive behavior    oh   the irony of it    tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case   and living the life to back it up    in gridlock d   shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him    spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall   but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction    mostly it comes through those eyes   eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta    it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch s pure appetite   and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self destructiveness   he reveals that he is hiv 1itive even as he is preparing to shoot up again   which is as much an obstacle to spoon s goal as any agency or enemy    gridlock d s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch   helping   spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife   and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him    with friends like that   spoon doesn t need enemies   and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much    the tragedy now is that we won t get more chances to see those eyes again    ,1

 for those of us who weren t yet born when the 196-1 s rock  n  rolled around   monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies    from otis redding to jimi hendrix   janis joplin to the mamas and the papas   and jefferson airplane to the who   this documentary is jam packed with contagious energy    but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending   which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves    shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock   the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time    sure   some have painted their faces and smoke joints   but d   a    pennebaker   the war room   moon over broadway   surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience    no matter who is watching   it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul    the excitement starts before the music even begins    a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer   she replies that she feels lucky to do so    there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips   leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers   tries to get in touch with dionne warwick    and when one band is tuning up   a member remarks     finally   a decent sound system !    you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn t about vanity   it s about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it   a two way street    this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience    it s im1sible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain    and while the lyrics to   wild thing   may not be all that complicated   watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love    even if you don t recognize every band you see on stage   you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats    the only drawback to the film is the ending   which unfortunately i must reveal    all the other bands   big names then and still today   got approximately 7 to 1-1 minutes of screen time    in contrast   the last band on camera   a wholly forgettable one   gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time    for a film that s only 78 minutes long   that s too large of a chunk   especially when previous acts are much more stimulating    all in all   monterey pop is a precious   rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us    the variety of music   as well as the beautifully shot performances   are easy to become immersed in    if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular   this is quickly dispelled    it s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn t get made much anymore    instead we re stuck with * nsync   the backstreet boys   and jennifer lopez   all of whom should have stuck with modeling    ,1
 the most common   and in many cases the only   complaint against francis ford coppola s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia   which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour   loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler   kinder ages    martin scorsese   another italoamerican moviemaker   confronted that perspective with his own   more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets   movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime    unfortunately for scorsese   his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies    seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime    this film was goodfellas   epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 199-1s    goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story   told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi   who would co write the screenplay for the film      the book   as well as the film   chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill   played by ray liotta     irish italian criminal from new york    at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero   played by paul sorvino     local mob boss   and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands    after couple of years   together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito   played by joe pesci     he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway   played by robert de niro      three of them spend years as best friends and associates   gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history    wealth   influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen   played by lorraine bracco     who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities   domestic abuse   arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business    but the perfect world of   wiseguys   gradually begins to fall apart   tommy s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence   jimmy s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and   finally   henry s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends    goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory    scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker    world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating    scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence   hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime   yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny    after being ex1ed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history   based on some notorious real life events     the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths   trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens    scorsese also manages to break viewer s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material   scenes that depict personal tragedies   broken homes   human depravity   violence   bloodshed and murder   in all their uncompromising reality   but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience    with the use of ironic soundtrack   manipulative shots   character s dialogue or narrator s commentary   goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era    even if we don t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining   we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker    first   we might notice unusual structure of the plot   relatively minor subplot is used as movie s ironic prologue    then   instead of single narrator   scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards    this multiple points of views   both in terms of narration and various subjective shots   only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation    same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack    nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy listening 195-1s pop songs   while depression   paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 196-1s and 197-1s    but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment   almost pastoral   easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed    however   thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people    such scenes   although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings   became very popular among other directors in 199-1s    fragmentary character of the screenplay   which doesn t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes   gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese    he uses this structure of film to experiment   and most successful of such experiments is hilarious   a day in life   segment near the end of the film    another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents    the most respectable among them is robert de niro   but his character   who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio   gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues    joe pesci deserved his   oscar   for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy   and his lines   including ad libs   probably represent the most memorable element of the film    ray liotta   although equally talented   perhaps doesn t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film    liotta s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thugs    liotta   on the other hand   improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction    lorraine bracco is   on the other hand   very effective and believable as karen hill   wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband    paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso   and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave    as a combination of clever sociological study   black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do   work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time    because of this achievement   and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers   this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 199-1s    ,1
    the blair witch project   was perhaps one of a kind   a unique film that played completely on its own merit   managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses    its success made a sequel inevitable   but this is not the sequel   i suspect   anyone much wanted    after the release of   the blair witch project     tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville   in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch    locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity   selling twig sculptures   stones and dirt like those in the movie   and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn   shouting     get out of these woods and go home !  there is no goddamned blair witch !      jeff     is one of those people   who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage    after he got released from the mental institution   he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet    as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods   on the   blair witch hunt      among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend   the pregnant tristen   who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called   the blair witch   history or hysteria       and kim   who dresses in black and has some psychic powers    the last member of the crew is erica   a young beautiful witch wannabe   who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore   saying   the first rule of wicca is   do no harm   because whatever you do will come back to you threefold      this strange group plunges into the woods   where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience    on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr s abandoned house   strange things start happening    when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain    after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies    they are somehow lost in time   as it loops uncontrollably back and forth    they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality    the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods      documentary director joe berlinger     paradice lost     helms   blair witch 2     leaving the creators of the first film   dan myrick and ed sanches   in the background    the opening scenes  the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film   is a more promising approach   because instead of trying to cover similar ground   it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand    but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story   that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue    in a way   this is a typical hollywood sequel    more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail    the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated    of course in these situations   quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values    from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody red forest   with carter burwell s     being john malkovich   and   fargo     musical score in the background   you realize that with the exception of its title   this film has absolutely nothing to do with   the blair witch project         blair witch        was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation    in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection   creating a completely different atmosphere    with its graceful cinematography   production design and flashy editing   the film has a very polished look   which is im1sible to associate with the first installment    and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times   he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor    the key is simplicity       blair witch project   had a story which was incredibly simple    that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination    the film was practically an empty screen   on which we projected our most frightening nightmares    the effect was incredibly powerful   lasting and entir e everyone   but in a different way       book of shadows   feels incredibly controlled and restrict    here   very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and   clever   that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it    there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with    this is simply a less artistic film that doesn t have the talent and originality of its predecessor    it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn t always succeed    but most importantly   it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie   which doesn t allow it to destroy the original    in the end   i can t call it a bad effort    it s less artistic   not so scary and less original   but certainly not bad    it s simply different    in fact   if you haven t seen   the blair witch project     you might like this film for what it is    a cross between   the blair witch project   and the   scream    films    the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting   jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned   and incredible sense of surrealism    but it s a common knowledge and experience that   with a few exceptions   every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making    to me the story of   the blair witch project   seemed completed   but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that   the book of shadows   is certainly assured    and it s already time to look forward to   blair witch 3      ,1
 seen may 31   1999 on home video   rented      one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own   everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise    with some films it might be just a secondary issue   but with `dark city  what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are   which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie    there s an old role playing computer game called `d   ja v     wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can t remember who he is   where he is and how he got there    the goal is to gather as many clues as 1sible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict    the premise to this film is not unlike that game   only this time we don t have control over the protagonist    we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city   actually   it s more than just the city   it s the whole reality   that isn t just that neo gothic look   a la `batman     `blade runner         but is so fully developed it s almost a different genre completely    later he will learn that his name is john murdoch   sewell     but for now he has no idea what s going on other than the fact something is not right    the fact there s a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious   hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling    this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre   horrific tone    the man doesn t know who he is nor where he s going and it s interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him    in fact   this is the way all stories begin since it s im1sible to know the history of a character   their feelings   values   morals   etc   until after we ve observed them for a while    but in this case   the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization   developing the mood and outlining the story    eventually   some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police    we met inspector frank bumstead   hurt     a quiet   unemotional   soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time    two other important characters are also introduced   dr   daniel p   schreber   sutherland     a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john s doctor   and emma murdoch   connelly     a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film noir movies    it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film    he also contacts emma   which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex   mysterious back story    but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city     which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo    everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance   considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot   its lighting   art direction and overall production design   they don t seem to be able to afford any gratuities    however   that might also be what s keeping it from reaching its maximum potential    by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place   so much unlike the real world we know   we come to realize that it s all a hoax    everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction    but   as the film s tagline says   `last night   one of us went off      for reasons that are never clearly explained   it appears that john 1sesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive   a process known as `tuning       the aliens   which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin   also 1sess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight    at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made   they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then    this premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard    he does provide some explanations such as that dr   schreber is an assistant to `the strangers  because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form    the aliens mix and match the memories of the city s population to see who will change and who will not    in the process this creates for a good deal of deep   thought provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world    however   where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is    the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened   yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant   static and cold   mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don t help either      for example   john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her   yet in some scenes crucial to the film s plot   we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other   which is also part of the film s climax and ending    and that s what proyas seems to be inferring with the film   but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense    ironically   this is what made his first film `the crow  work so well   which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical   dark twisted world    with `dark city  the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message    still   the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable    there s a lot to like here   most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does    the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years    `dark city  is what the movies are all about   the escape from the real world    ,1
 linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction   and her being cast as dogma s lead is nothing short of inexplicable    she s still in fine form as bethany   an abortion clinic worker who s lost her faith    one night   a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany s bedroom    he is metatron   alan rickman     the voice of god   and he needs her help   she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church the fate of the universe depends on it    god would do it him/herself   but he/she is       missing   having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again    bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the   prophets   jay   jason mewes   and silent bob   kevin smith   doing double duty     the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith s films thus far    at some point   rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus   the undocumented   and very black     thirteenth a1tle     and offers his assistance   as does divine stripper serendipity   salma hayek      it s a wild ride    they re in pursuit of loki and bartleby   damon and affleck   respectively this is probably the sharpest either has ever been     who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return    loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates    at one point   he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets    it s a nasty   guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks     how corrupt are you        wings of desire this ain t    since debuting with clerks   smith has grown as a director   particularly in terms of working with actors       chris rock is this film s only weak link between jokes   he s wooden      his no frills visual style hasn t changed much over the years   though   dogma s widescreen com1itions at least have blockbuster affectations     nor has his writing his characters still sit around delivering one caustic   hilarious speech after another    dogma chips away at big religious issues namely   the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs eloquently and articulately   but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant ex1ition    as well   the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever    any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum   hurlyburly   anyone       and eventually dogma s pacing goes slack    a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game   in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings   comes at a point when we ve heard enough    because his change of heart   bartleby is initially the good cop to loki s bad   drives the climax   said rant is given a great deal of screen time    sure   affleck deserved a big moment   damon steals their scenes together prior     but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated    like tarantino   smith was a video age sponge who became a sample mad indie filmmaker    dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies   including indiana jones and the last crusade   with silent bob doing his best harrison ford   and weird science a shit demon attacks our heroes !  smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour   his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical   a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan   catholicism wow !     and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished    i bust   ed     a gut on several occasions    proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever    it s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease   for to read it   one actually has to see dogma    the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ s   martin scorsese s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis  controversial novel   in that it is not directly linked to the picture s content but to rumours and heresy    there s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime   just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against       not one of them had watched it      every single person refused    smith and scorsese have a lot in common   and so do the two films in question   because both smith s bethany and scorsese s jesus are hollow shells without their faith    in fact   dogma s denouement   which follows a thrilling showdown that s worth the wait   is a catholic love in   a veritable recruitment 1ter       i felt sentimental about a religion i don t belong to    now that s powerful filmmaking     smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god   and that spirituality shines through    it s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins    my religion is movies    when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine   in a roundabout way they re attacking what i live for   freedom of expression through celluloid    i therefore feel that   although i m no bible thumper   i m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers    ,1
 you ve heard all the hype    you ve seen all their faces   natalie portman   the professional   as queen amidala   liam neeson   schindler s list   as qui gon jinn   ewan mcgregor   trainspotting   as obi wan kenobi   and jake lloyd   jingle all the way   as young anakin skywalker    if you ve read any reviews   you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy    you also may have heard that this one s too kiddie friendly   and doesn t have enough content for adults    believe the hype    the effects are stunning   the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic   the lightsaber duels are amazing   and queen amidala s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth    but there s something missing here   and it isn t budget or effects   it s everything money * can t * buy    the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters    the most successful at this is liam neeson who   as qui gon jinn   a jedi master to young obi wan kenobi   has quiet dignity and a wise   commanding presence    he is the anchor to this movie   as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out    portman s queen amidala and mcgregor s obi wan kenobi don t fare nearly so well    amidala   the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation     !       comes off as stoic   stilted and caricatured   it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life      and obi wan   although mcgregor makes him very endearing   has so little screen time that he s nothing but a robin to qui gon jinn s batman    however   mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity   and he does a good job    he also absolutely nails alec guiness    obi wan in episode 4   6   scottish accent   and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise    in fact   lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit   and that s one of the problems with this film    i would never call myself a   star wars   fan   especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days   but i ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america    however   if you are the one person in america who * hasn t * seen the films at all or even recently   or who doesn t bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters   you may be hopelessly lost    for example   one of the film s main   nefarious   characters is senator palpatine    for those of you not recently steeped in   star wars   trivia   emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader s master in   return of the jedi   and   empire strikes back      so   obviously   his appearance in   phantom menace   is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series   thus making his role here more meaningful    a lot of the movie is like that    r2 d2 and c 3po make token appearances   and it s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience s pre existing fondness for them        because he doesn t do much to add to it in any way    same goes for jabba the hutt   who doesn t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy    even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film   tatooine   the desert world where luke grew up     coruscant   the cloud city from   empire strikes back       and alderaan   leia s home planet   which we never actually see   that gets blown up in   star wars     show up or are mentioned briefly in passing    what s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films    the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty    there s no meat   no substance   that makes you want to love the characters as they are   not as they will be    another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film    i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters   strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters   had mouths that barely moved   making them look more like muppets than actual characters    and jar jar binks   a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character   is intended as comic relief   but what he really becomes is annoying   and fast    unlike chewbacca and c 3po   who got their humanity   if you ll pardon the expression   from their interactions with the human characters   jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind   at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive   teenage mutant ninja turtles      furthermore   the dialogue is often stilted and corny   and sometimes downright infantile   thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot    oddly   this isn t just * my * judgment   lucas has said that he designed this film for kids    well   he s done a good job    the hero of this film   of course   is young anakin   but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy    that s not jake lloyd s fault   though   he does a good job of being a cute kid   which is apparently all lucas asked of him    that s another mistake   of course   because the cute tyke becomes darth vader    warning   spoilers ahead ! ! ! !  in my opinion   there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin s future evil in the film    the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks   and there s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie    he has a doting mother   pernilla august   making her first english  language film   and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine    but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn t all hearts and roses is yoda s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui gon jinn    his explanation       his future is clouded         warning   major spoiler ahead    enter at your own risk      of course   the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul   a scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts   but has turned to the dark side    this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie   but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber   and his scary facial makeup    because qui gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force   obi wan   qui gon s young padawan apprentice   one level below knightdom     must take over the training himself    so   at the end of the movie   we end where the saga actually begins   with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice   anakin   darth vader   skywalker    did this story need to be told    i would say no    but is it a worthwhile movie to see    absolutely    if you don t enter the theater with jedi size expectations   and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle   then this is your movie    the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation    the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight    and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler   happier time    above all   this is a fun movie    not deep   not meaningful   and not profound    but fun    maybe next time   lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script   and the guy who directed   empire   will direct    because if lucas does the next one himself   it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most   potential          ,1
 as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell   there is a wonderful   eye catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film    the shot has tibbs  face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars    to see these bars blocking his face   we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film    as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots   no matter how innocent tibbs is   he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin    the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is   instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous    this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds    it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film       in the heat of the night   was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america    jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental    in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers    he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present    preceding the very original   a soldier s story   and the recently released   the hurricane       in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters    the film   which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs   played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted    tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him    as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains   tibbs is the perfect protagonist    poitier also gives an excellent   noteworthy voice to his character    never nervous and always commanding   his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing    however   unlike   the hurricane   where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast   poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger   who won best actor for his excellent performance    as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him   steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role    he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople    he would refer to tibbs as   boy   and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him    as the film progresses though   there is a very gradual change in the sheriff    he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors    what i really enjoyed about steiger s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film    he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil    instead   it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future    most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes    this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly im1sible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day    jewison s determination to make this film as realistic as 1sible is very obvious here and also very appropriate       in the heat of the night   shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 196-1 s    it displays this perfectly    however   the actual investigation   although it is not the main focus of the film   lacks interest    it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim    there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane   police officer sam being a suspect was not needed      also   it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does   but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered    the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic       a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson    he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967     in the heat of the night   and the even better   in cold blood        ,1
 in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance    ever since wall street   douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid 8-1 s    in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen   with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world    you d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good natured veneer   but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton   douglas played the role straight and out in the open    in wonder boys his performance isn t showy or a tour de force   it s simple yet truthful    he embodies grady   a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes    grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map    when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop   we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms    grady points out   in his narration   that they only do so out of jealousy    their target is the very writerly named james leer   played by the always understated tobey maguire     a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for    leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions    he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges    he s portentous and gloomy   as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers   though his act is a little too calculated    he reminds me of the self im1ed outcast film director   jim jarmusch   dead man   ghost dog      whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner   the monotonous drawl sup1edly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer     exclusively dressed in black   and with his spiked hair dyed snow white    leer is similar   a guy who equates quirks with depth    tobey maguire fits well in the role    with his round   sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude    but unlike cort   maguire is easier to warm up to   he s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility    katie holmes plays hannah   a beautiful   talented writing student just itching to get in grady s pants    this is a plot line i had trouble with    douglas   in his old age   is beginning to resemble jerry springer   a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions    at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady   maybe it s because i m jealous   and wish holmes was throwing herself at me   after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth     then i think of douglas s real life companion   the breathtaking catherine zeta jones    seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping    suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand   that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie   and i m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas    there is a movie in there somewhere    grady   rather chivalrously if you ask me   resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell   a droll frances mcdormand     who is his age   but also married to another professor    okay   maybe not so chivalrous    there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says     she was a junkie for the printed word    lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice      robert downy j   r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm    downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual    he s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance    the actor is perfectly cast here   and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor    i wish wonder boys had more of him    searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless   for it meanders through its running time   but that s part of its charm    and maybe i m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia   a place i m greatly fond of   and a place rarely explored in american cinema    everyone has a sub genre   be it war films   westerns   dance movies   that they happen to be privy to    i m privy to films about literary types i   e    those individuals enthralled by the written word   and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch    the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters   rather than generic mapped out story points    sometimes the dialogue is too clever   but that s a problem i wish i found with films more often    another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted   like its characters   but as the story progresses it begins to open up    for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types   and as a low key comedy for its chuckle worthy throwaway gags    the gags are like those in the great robert altman   m * a * s * h   the long goodbye   movies   where jokes exist as asides on the fringes   like jokes in life often do    the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog   and incessant smoking of marijuana isn t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things    curtis hanson   who before his last film   la confidential   toiled about with exploitation fare like losin  it   an early tom cruise sex comedy   and the hand the rocks the cradle   has graduated to more meaningful films    he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style   the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up    the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party   but in a wonder boys party   it fits    the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen    it s the cinematic equivalent to a good read   novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies    many will find it slight   but i found much to savor among its subtleties    ,1
 plot   derek zoolander is a male model    he is also very dumb and impressionable    for that reason   he is secretly hired and trained   so secret   that even he doesn t know about it   by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia   who wants to abolish child labor in his country    will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed    will zoolander ever grace the world his new   look      is this a funny movie    find out below        critique   there s a place in our world for   stupid comedies      films which don t pretend to take themselves seriously   are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes    there s also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history   might be an ideal circumstance during which to   relax   by watching something so completely frivolous    well   if you re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment   ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time    of course   comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny   while others will grant them the   stupid     but consider it funny instead    i personally enjoyed it for the most part   cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry    snap !  it was also nice to see several real life models with small roles in the movie   not taking themselves too seriously    and if you re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films   well   don t look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn   billy zane   winona ryder   christian slater   david duchovny   natalie portman and many   many others    i especially liked andy dick s complete make over as the masseuse    hi larious !  but with all films of this type   there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn t work    a few particulars which didn t strike my fancy included the bulimia and   orgy   sequence with christine taylor   the break dance fighting   and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this   why not just   make up   a country   instead of zeroing in on a certain people        i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general   since she wasn t all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then   more zoolander   dude !      but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me !  i almost pissed myself during the   gas station   disaster   absolutely adored the   walk off   contest   with david bowie as the judge   no less   and appreciated many of zoolander s moronic one liners     i was a merman       a  merman ! !        and i dare you to get his   monkey   photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie     you re a monkey   derek       a  monkey !      i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film   both of which zipped and zagged   and established a nice rhythm to it all    again   it s to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone   but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer   you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well    if you thought the trailer was dumb   skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something   a film from which there is an obvious influence here    blue steel   baby       yeah ! ! !  where s joblo coming from    austin powers   7/1-1     austin powers 2   7/1-1     deuce bigalow   7/1-1     dude   where s my car   7/1-1     freddy got fingered   5/1-1     jay & silent bob strike back   8/1-1     joe dirt   5/1-1     meet the parents   8/1-1     say it isn t so   3/1-1    ,1
 unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi   an artist whose palette is fabric    ostensibly   the film is a documentary   but use of that term requires stretching its meaning    many scenes appear staged   and a great deal of cutting and pasting has been done in the editing room    the cinema verite effect is a conceit    genuine spontaneity is at a premium   and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera   especially would be actresses like cindy crawford      director douglas keeve   who was mizrahi s lover at the time   freely admits that he   couldn t care less about the truth   but was more interested in capturing   the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion      despite violating nearly every rule of   legitimate   documentary film making   however   unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment    while it sheds only a little light on the behind the scenes world of the fashion industry   it presents a fascinating   if incomplete   picture of designer mizrahi    this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study    he s funny   energetic   and eminently quotable    he has unusual views on just about everything   from fashion     it s about women not wanting to look like cows     to mary tyler moore     between her and jackie kennedy   they shaped this country     to style     it s almost im1sible to have style nowadays without the right dogs        unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress    it s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine    the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look   including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies   then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection    in particular   unzipped traces mizrahi s development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show   which highlights a number of prominent models   including cindy crawford   naomi campbell   kate bush   and linda evangelista    on the technical side   a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped    a variety of film stocks were used   super 8   16 mm black and white   and 35 mm color    there is a pur1e to this beyond simple artiness    the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie   and   during the climactic fashion show   color is used to show the audience s perspective   while black and white is for the behind the  scenes sequences    nevertheless   some viewers will be put off by this treatment    while unzipped isn t an ex1e on the fashion industry per se   keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear    overall   however   this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else   and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed    when the designer declares that   everything is frustrating except designing clothes    that s beautiful and liberating     it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed    ,1

 the event of events is upon us    people have waited twenty two years for the prequel to star wars and die hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it    i don t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused    it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history    anyone who tells you   it s just a movie   is either lying or clueless    it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic    the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz   which is far too weak a word   that star wars epsode i   the phantom menace so effortlessly generated    but that does not mean that the film itself is bad    in fact   it is terrific    i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash    it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place    the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging   the trade federation   angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small   peaceful planet of naboo    the republic sent two jedi knights   people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as   the force       qui gon jinn   liam neeson   and obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   to -1otiate    unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur   the jedi and the queen of naboo   natalie portman   escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene    on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine   where they meet the movie s real focal point   young anakin skywalker   jake lloyd      he is an innocent slave boy   but   the force is strong with him   so qui  gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi    as any self respecting star wars fan should know   anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker    >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor s movie    around 7-1% of the characters   if not more   are computer generated in one form or another   and though the effects are seamless   the movie lacks soul    i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade   cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this    this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far   with plenty of broad comic relief to go around   much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar jar binks    he s essentially a computer animated sidekick who says things like   exqueeze me      and   mesa go now   okeday       and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying    the visual effects are astounding   although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them   and the movie is a thrilling triumph    if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement    the climactic lightsaber battle   oh   come on   as if you didn t already know     among other things   is outrageously entertaining and defines the term   popcorn movie      what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams    even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days   his work here is nothing short of brilliant    his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling    the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia    when you see   a long time ago   in a galaxy far   far away     when the familiar music plays   when the words   star wars   appear on screen   you ll feel a tingle even if you didn t see the movie when it first came out in  77    it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin   a boy whose innocence   we know   will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side    it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts   we know that it will do more harm than good   but they do not    we not only feel more involved in the story   but we feel like we re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years    the phantom menace   although lacking in human aspects of the story   is a very worthy installment in the star wars    it works as an action flick   visually eye popping and often paralyzingly exciting   it also works as an elicitor of memories   a piece of exquisite nostalgia       1999 eugene novikov&#137    ,1
 sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest    some people call it   original   or   artsy   or   abstract      some people simply call it   trash      a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings    definitely a generation x aimed movie   a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke based musical dream sequence    whew !  anyone in their 3-1 s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film    it s somewhat silly   it s somewhat outrageous   and it s definitely not your typical romance story   but for the right audience   it works    a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting    well sorry folks   but i haven t seen trainspotting so i can t really compare    whether that works in this film s favor or not is beyond me    but i do know this   ewan mcgregor   whom i had never had the pleasure of watching   definitely charmed me    he was great !  cameron diaz s character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp    the audience may find it difficult to care about her   thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him    misguided    you bet    loveable    you bet    a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city   utah    this was just one more thing i didn t know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke    maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise   but i think even if i had known   i would have been just as happy    a life less ordinary is quirky   eccentric   and downright charming !  not for everyone   but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies    ,1
 that thing you do !     r   tom hanks s screenwriting and directorial debut   that thing you do !   has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment   fun   lively   and oh so nice    it is the latter quality   however   that becomes a hindrance   for this  6-1s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast    that thing focuses on the wonders   a teen rock band from erie   pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called   of course     that thing you do !    the group s members are   naturally a diverse group   there s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy   johnathon schaech     girl crazy lenny   steve zahn     the lead guitarist   a goofy   geeky type known only as the bass player   ethan embry     and the film s center   guy   tom everett scott     the drummer who has aspirations in jazz    along for the wonders  ride to success is jimmy s perpetually -1lected galpal   faye   liv tyler      hanks proves to be a capable writer director   deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964   which hanks calls   the last innocent year      the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music   which   like the other recent period music film   grace of my heart   was expressly written for the film   hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes  but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger   which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled   it s still playing in my mind as i write this      it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors   eliciting charming   likable work from the entire cast   most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler   who is remarkable in delivering the film s biggest and best dramatic moment    the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early  6-1s   they do not appear to be  9-1s grungers playacting   retro      yet for all the light   frothy charms of that thing you do !   it s nearly nice to a fault    while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days   there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting    everyone is so happy   basking in the glow of overnight success   marvelling at it all  except toward the end   but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness   ending on an appropriately feel good note    there isn t much of an edge throughout that thing  the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks s turn as the wonders  manager  and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it s bland    but a little niceness goes a long way these days   and there s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do !   it s just about im1sible to hate    it s an inoffensive   enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming   if not singing     that thing you do !     quite  1sibly for days    to paraphrase a passage from the song   though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play   that thing you do !    ,1
    he s back   and it s about time      was the motto for this television series pilot   i call it a pilot   i don t care what fox network says   revival of the cult classic british tv show   doctor who   that spawned no series   which means there are no smart network execs out there   not exactly news to a lot of people   i know      the motto was well chosen    the series was simple   it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies   including the evil daleks   and the master   who appears in this feature   played very badly by eric roberts    as good as this revival was   there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who    is it the acting    hell   no !  paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who ve played the doctor   including his predecessor and off screen friend sylvester mccoy   who appears once more for the regeneration scene      he looks right for the role   is a brilliant actor   and slips effortlessly into the role   the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would    daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr   grace holloway   the doctor s first companion that he kisses on screen   she is not your typical female companion who screams   and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor   she is a tough   spunky american   and ashbrook shows this well    young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee   and i ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end   this film included     which   imho   wastes his talent    the only problem with the acting is eric roberts    one time he had to say to mcgann s doctor     i always dress for the occasion      but he broke it up   and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric     i always        dress        for the occasion      you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act   and who s also british   like mcgann is as the doctor    executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role    i dunno who thought of casting him   but if they re reading this   news flash   eric roberts is * not * a star !  he rides on his sister s coattails   and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him    is this problem the kisses to the past    they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them   only whovians would   and they re good    is it the script or the movie as a whole    the script is a classy piece of work   featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue   and the movie as a whole is one fans will love   and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series    so what is it    simple   no plot    the master   on his last legs   sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him    the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey   but they accidentally land in san francisco   1999   december 31   where the master   with young street hood chang lee s help   opens the eye of harmony   which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor   with the help of female surgeon   dr   grace holloway   doesn t close it by then    virtually no plot    i was told the movie would ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks   but a lot of rewriting went on on the set    that shows how smart people are   as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting   and that would ve gotten a four star rating out of me    ,1
 dreamworks pictures presents a jinks/ cohen company production kevin spacey annette bening   american beauty   thora birch allison janney peter gallagher mena suvari wes bentley and chris cooper co producers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l   hall   a   s   c    produced by bruce cohen & dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes     both my wife and daughter think i m this gigantic loser    and they re right    i have lost something    i didn t always feel this sedated      with that piece of dialogue   we are fully introduced to lester burnham   kevin spacey     a 42 year old man trapped within his own life    lester works for an advertising agency    his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid life crisis he is suffering    estranged from both his wife and his daughter   lester starts to crack under the stress    his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies   and sullen apathy    carolyn burnham   annette bening     is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker    she carefully tends her rose garden   decorates her home with the best furnishings    but inside she is desperate    unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent   she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family    the third member of this anti family is jane burnham   thora birch     lester and carolyn s daughter    a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence   but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction    this funny   and frightening   slice of life is refreshingly simple    not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her    some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters    most notably is barbara fitts   allison janney     the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts    she has almost no dialogue   and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one    colonel fitts   chris cooper   is an angry and frightened man    his rage directed almost singularly at his son   ricky   wes bentley   who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham s    in fact they are the next door neighbors    anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in   american beauty      alan ball   who was the co executive producer of the hit tv series   cybil   and creator of the new sitcom   oh grow up     has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years    not one character in this film rings falsely    and the depth of personality in each   is achingly honest and insightful    the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as   the graduate   or   lolita      kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances    his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age    finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become   lester tries to return to his youth    he quits his job   actually blackmailing his employer for one year s salary     starts smoking pot   fantasizes about his daughter s girlfriend angela   mena suvari   in a marvelous performance here     starts working out   and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet    mr   spacey s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous   that we can be certain that come oscar   time   we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees    annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career    carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy    unable to cope with her growing disillusionment   she forces herself to maintain her demeanor   driving her further and further into desperation   adultery and 1sibly murder    ms   bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone    the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words    thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her    jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family   and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment    her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning    she is the prototypical trophy child    when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team     i m so proud of you   honey    you didn t screw up once !       the bitterness and resentment are palpable    thora birch is a young actress to watch    praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance    colonel finn is a man in complete denial    his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend    wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma    the boy next door who may be more foe than friend    a deceitful and calculating young man   whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him    mr   bentley s performance is the one troublesome note in the film    that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar   that one almost faults the performance for it    director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and com1ed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle    scenes of carolyn walking through the rain   carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character    the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is

 will hunting   matt damon   is a natural genius    for a movie character   that s usually a death sentence    it s a trait associated with what my brother calls   too good for this world   movies   like phenomenon or powder    forgive me for spoiling the ending   but will doesn t die    this is no formula movie    in fact   it s quite fresh and original    it s a character study more than anything   and that s not surprising   considering it was written by two actors   damon and co star ben affleck    will works whatever kind of job he can get    first he s a janitor   then he works construction    off screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him    on screen he hangs out with his friends   picking fights in robust   romanticized hemingway fashion    lambeau   stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves     a math professor   learns that the janitor   will   is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics    having confirmed he s not a fluke or a savant   he does what he can to get will into the education system    he is firmly rejected    finally   will lands in jail for one of his fights    lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him    will   barely   decides to go for the therapy over prison    lambeau treats will like a son    he s proud of   and amazed by   will s accomplishments in mathematics    he encourages will and tries to give him structure   knowing that   with a little discipline   he could be bigger than einstein    will isn t really interested in academia    he knows he would be the best in his field   and therefore spend all of his time in an office   explaining math to people like lambeau    he would rather work construction   which breaks lambeau s heart    meanwhile   will attends his mandated therapy sessions    it s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau s   a   list    will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade   and how to keep them from affecting him    shrink after shrink refuses to return after will s mockery    lambeau s last hope is his old college roommate   now a psychology teacher at a small time community college    knowing that will is going to try to shred him too   sean   robin williams   agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein    true to form   will finds sean s emotional weakness and attacks    but unlike the other shrinks   sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions    like a foster mother with a fussy child   sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride    like the foster mother   sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach    robin williams is excellent in this role    he s not an actor with a great range   but in the right roles he has great depth    in this movie   as in awakenings   there comes a point when the quiet   shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance   and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes    williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling    i have compared will to a foster child and that s not entirely fair    emotionally   he has a lot to learn   but he is not a child    he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants    sean   his girlfriend   his pals   and lambeau all help him grow   but he didn t start out asking for   or particularly needing   help    his exceptional gift singled him out   and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction    if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama    it s too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama   but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama    it is emotionally engaging   but it s not quite larger than life    this isn t a problem per se   but at times i didn t know quite how to take it    but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie    a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow    it doesn t just happen   it takes a good script   good acting   and good direction    good will hunting has all three    if you are at all inclined to see it   by all means   go    ,1
 if there s one thing in common about all of hollywood s major studios   it s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more    although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures   fox searchlight and fine line respectively     it s obvious there s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater    so when a movie like gary ross  pleasantville comes along   wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production   it s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes    although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted   pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no thought movie    quite the op1ite is true   in fact   as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen    the story   both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation   captures the essence of statement making in the cinema    not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution   and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross  work   it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough    kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture    it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who   through quite a bit of luck   find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named   pleasantville      maguire   as the reserved bud parker   is perfect for the pseudo world   but the rebellious mary sue   witherspoon   is not at all made for the father knows best times    it s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end   and begins to teach the townspeople   in a quite unlikely way   what life is * really * like    soon hues of color creep into the black and white world   and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism   others fear the strangeness    at one end is a soda shop owner turned painter named mr   johnson   jeff daniels   and at the other end is a close minded mayor   j   t    walsh   and his chamber of commerce   but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town    fine performances are turned in all around    maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads   but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j   t    walsh   in his latest and final 1thumous performance      daniels brings an atmosphere of awe   inspiration   and hope to his character   whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness   almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman s envy    for daniels   it s his most commendable performance of the last three years   or more   and for walsh   it s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career    also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen   and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish    there s not much to dislike about pleasantville   and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don t    ,1

 `we run tings    tings don t run we       sound advice from capone   paul campbell   to his squaddie   or partner     floyd   winston bell      jamaican film   shot entirely on video   featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo styled brotherhood morals   and a little gunplay      capone   a tough as nails super cop   gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home   while he was with his lady   and killed his partner in front of him    when he arrives   he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse   thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie   jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw     so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook      capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and   much to his disappointment   also finds out his childhood friend ratty   mark danvers   has been helping him    torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend   capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again    directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne   assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct     one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while    shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films   although the action isn t as hyperkinetic as most of woo s films are    the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though   and eventually begin to take on a life of their own   beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after      the make up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well   with flawless squib work on display from the effects team    the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue   spoken with thick jamaican accents   half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang     just adds to the interest    paul campbell   as the `loose cannon  capone   essays his role perfectly   displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times    mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty   the part time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together    unfortunately   carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective   largely because his underlings seem to run all over him     but then again   that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed    the music in the film is com1ed of all reggae songs   and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists   sly and robbie   who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones   maxi priest   bob dylan   james brown   grace jones   herbie hancock   bootsy collins   and carly simon among others      the end credit song   `we run tings    by the group red dragon   is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review    oddly enough   desmond ballentine   who plays the character deportee   is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta  reggae as the performer ninjaman   and he doesn t contribute a single song to the film   that i could see     which is virtually unheard of here in the us    at the time of this writing   third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us   coming off of a six month box office breaking run in jamaica   where it holds the 1ition as highest grossing film of all time   bringing in $21 million in jamaica   which is roughly $5-1-1   -1-1-1 us      palm pictures   the company that released the offbeat   but entertaining six string samurai   is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market   i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters    chris blackwell   founder of palm pictures   was also involved in the production of another jamaican box office smash in 1981 entitled countryman   so i d say he has a pretty good track record    overall   third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo   ringo lam   tsui hark   and many other action films by directors from hong kong    if action films are your thing and you don t mind intermittent subtitles   then you can t go wrong with this film    the performances and the story are solid   if only a little cliched   and the action is tight    i m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like   but apparently third world cop s honors are well deserved    ,1
 at first glance   it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8 year olds    that s true of home alone 2 and i d bet money that it s true of home alone 3   opening soon      but home alone actually has a lot going for it   and the cartoon slapstick doesn t get in the way    the mcalisters   all 15 of them   are going to france for the holidays    four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse    the littlest kid   kevin   is the victim of the older kids  cruelty    kevin s patience runs out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza has already been eaten   and he s going to have to starve    he attacks his big bully brother buzz   who had been teasing him    the fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner   spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table   a few cousins   and an uncle    the knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin    nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased   but they all point their fingers when he fights back    the ultimate punishment comes from mom   catherine o hara   who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night    on his way up the stairs   he tells her that   families suck   and that he hopes never to see any of his family again    that night the power goes out   knocking out the alarm clocks   so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport    in a surprisingly plausible setup   kevin is mistakenly accounted for   and the family heads off without him    it s interesting that   in a subtle way   his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children    first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling   and second   they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class    they re two thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child    meanwhile   kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true    he s finally rid of his family !  life is a dream come true    he can jump on the beds   watch r rated movies   eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips   and dig through his big brother s secret box    slowly   the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane    he grooms himself   he does the laundry   he goes shopping     i bought some milk   eggs   and fabric softener        he also starts to miss his family   not just for their company   but for the security they bring    the furnace in the basement is a scary monster   the old man next door is a snow shovel murderer   and two crooks are trying to break into his house    macaulay culkin is cute but he isn t much of an actor    still   we can see that kevin s character grows   thanks to some good direction and editing    for example   acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night   just as   santa   is getting in his car    kevin asks the man to pass on his request   he wants his family back   to the real santa    he learned how to deal with the furnace    you turn on the lights and it s not so scary anymore    he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow shovel murderer   who actually turns out to be a nice man    they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid    finally   in the last 2-1 minutes   kevin confronts his last fear   the bandits   head on   literally      this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick   and after the movie s genuine dramatic setup   it is dessert    it s a lot of fun   and it doesn t overwhelm the rest of the movie    on the whole   home alone is a great holiday movie    john williams  original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls   and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings    but it does have its flaws    the smallest problem is that culkin doesn t act very well    as i said before   he is cute   but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin s insight into his character    the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda   the villains threaten kevin s life about five times    instead of   i m gonna get that kid   they say   i m gonna kill that kid      some might argue that the tone is the same   but i strongly disagree    mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux pas    i ll probably never see home alone 3   and i wish i had skipped home alone 2   but i do enjoy home alone almost every year    don t let your impressions of the others detract from the original   which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick    ,1
    comedy   rated pg   runs about 1   4-1    starring   john goodman   kathy moriarty   and a bunch of teenagers    directed by joe dante and written by charles hass     summary   lawrence woolsley   john goodman   brings his new horror film mant !  to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis    he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town    we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them    quick and easy review   i really enjoyed matinee    the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely    unlike many comedies this film tries   and succeeds   in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh    the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story    the performances of all the principals are right on the mark   particularly john goodman as the schlock master    so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted   yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours    longer   more detailed review   [beware of spoilers]  the primary reason i enjoyed this film was   that while being a comedy   the film also had an intelligent story to tell    too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh    you watch the movie   laugh a lot   leave the theatre and take nothing with you    matinee is not like that    i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis    i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film    but most importantly   i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters    the comedy of the film centers around goodman   his character   and the film he brings to key west    i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today    he is highly expressive both physically and vocally    i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink    the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature   however   while the star   goodman is actually not at the center of the film    the movie is really the story of the four teenagers   discovering who they are and what they want   against a background where at any minute it could all end    i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic    they tried to block it out   they tried to escape from the concerns of their world    unfortunately it kept creeping back in   particularly with the fear   and the chaos of the time    while the comedy centered on goodman   and the drama on the teens   there was a great deal of overlap    several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light    one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store    if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy   but it works here    another reason i like this film is that i like b  science fiction movies    one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space       note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies   but one of my favorite to see      while mant !  never got made   many films like it were   and mant !  serves mostly as dante s homage to the b films he loves    so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good   humorous story    this isn t a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent   well thought out   film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way    enjoy !  ,1
 when  star wars  came out some twenty years ago   the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image    when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars   we see constellations   meteor showers   and cool space ships    when han solo goes light speed   the stars change to bright lines   going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point    cool     october sky  offers a much simpler image  that of a single white dot   traveling horizontally across the night sky    was it really only forty years ago   when sputnik was launched   and that before then   no satellites ever existed    have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then technological achievement   even though it was from the russians    it sounds hokey   but when that scene occurs near the beginning of  october sky    i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam   played by jake gyllenhaal    determined to make a dent in the space race   he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them    it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket    when lovely teacher miss riley   played by laura dern     suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair   we know exactly who is going to win    but the joy in a film like this is in the little details    for example   homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class    if he has any strengths whatsoever   it is an undeterring vision   and a good organizer    it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school   who knows more about rocket science than he does    it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property   that is   the entire coal mining town     he must walk eight miles one way   just to set up the rockets   which will fail   fail   fail   and fail again    homer+s dad is played by chris cooper   a favorite actor of mine since  lone star     here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in  matewan    instead of organizing union rallies   he is the head of the coal miners   who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions    this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year   note how multi dimensional his character is    he is his son+s last nemesis   as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams    but he truly loves his son   and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how    through coal mining    because of his character   we can see how far we+ve come    the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us    we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family    the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet   and he knew of no other life    so  october sky    far from being merely a feel good inspirational film   offers much food for thought    and this is the best type of inspirational film   the one that you take something with you    btw   the final image of the film is just as simple   is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal moving white dot against the night sky background    another commonplace image   to be sure   but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago    ,1
 warning   contains what the matrix is    rated r for sci fi violence    starring   keanu reeves   laurence fishburne   joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix    i ll tell you i was    i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen    now wait wait   i know most of you loved it   and i m not saying i didn t like it    what i m saying is the first half was extremely slow    now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show    don t be fooled   this movie has a big story    and big chunks of talky moments    but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par   deserving the rating above    ok now to the story    well this may take a while    ok first of all   our world we live in now   is not the real world   actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix    a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out   when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world    he does so   and finds out that he can do anything   be anything he wants to be    but he has to fight a  matrix skipping  bad guy   who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him    laurence fishburne   his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves    but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were    yeah there were some in the first half but not enough    the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie    now for the second half   it is explosive   and saves the movie    some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking    the sound   the music   and all the effects were effective   and the last hour kept us entertained    but with a running time of 2 hours and 2-1 minutes   this movie is at least 4-1 minutes too long    one would have wished for a better  matrix    but i do have to say   i did like it and i was entertained    ,1

 every year   hollywood crowns a new   it boy     a young actor pegged for major movie stardom    inheriting the mantle from last year s   winner     matthew mcconaughey   is matt damon   and   like mcconaughey   he proves to be more than just a fresh young face   as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release  john grisham s the rainmaker and good will hunting    damon has his first major starring role   a la mcconaughey   in a john grisham adaptation  in this case   francis ford coppola s take on the rainmaker    damon plays wet behind the ears attorney rudy baylor   who   immediately after passing the bar exam   finds himself representing the mother   mary kay place   of a terminally ill young man   john whitworth   in a big league suit against a -1ligent insurance company    while rudy s   and the film s   main concern is this case   he also finds time to protect a young wife   claire danes   from her abusive husband   melrose placer andrew shue   in a mercifully brief role      written for the screen and directed by coppola   the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously    coppola s most notable  and effective  contribution to the tried and true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself   which largely comes in the presence of danny devito   as rudy s unlicensed co counsel   and golden globe nominee jon voight   as the insurance company s hotshot attorney      the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous   but danes is as superb as always    then   of course   there is damon   who nicely juggles the weighty   the insurance case   the spousal abuse   and the humorous   rudy s often comical naivete   requirements of his role without missing a beat    as good as he is in the rainmaker   damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting   directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself    damon plays the title character   will hunting   a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius    in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction   an mit math professor   stellan skarsgard   taps his old college friend   community college psychologist sean mcguire   robin williams     to counsel the abrasive   standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life    good will hunting is the touchy feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests   but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon s intelligent script touches    even though no one   and   if so    very  few people   can directly relate to will s burden of superhuman intelligence   the insecurities he suffers are universal    the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors    williams delivers a nice dramatic turn   affleck   a hot up and coming actor himself   chasing amy     turns up in a warm and charming performance as will s best friend   and the ever appealing minnie driver shines as will s harvard schooled love interest    the clear standout in the cast   though   is damon   who bravely does not soften will s prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard  not  to care for him    so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine   but based on his impressive work in john grisham s the rainmaker and especially good will hunting   it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come    ,1
 synopsis   leonard shelby   pearce   is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife    leonard has only a few clues to the murderer s identity   to make matters worse   he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short term memories   meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier    because of this   leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself       memento   traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination    review     memento   is the sort of movie i wish i d written   i can think of no higher praise than that    i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant   involved   original movie as this    an instant film noir classic     memento   is virtually flawless    the script is unlike any i have ever seen    a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity    although the idea of starting at the   conclusion   of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the   start   is not entirely new   never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence       memento   is endlessly exciting and inventive   a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself   and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre    and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality   there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively    nolan s direction is equally effective   never losing its crispness and clarity despite   memento    s challenging gimmick    and to top everything off   all the performances rise to the occasion    pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard   moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie   and pantoliano s teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality       memento   may be the year s best screenplay   and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2-1-11    ,1
 earth is a harsh   unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent    people who sup1edly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict   as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets   indian and pakistani   muslim   hindu   sikh   parsee    the story takes place in lahore   which was indian before partition   and pakistani afterward   regardless of what its citizens might call themselves    the action is seen through the eyes of lenny   maaia sethna     a young parsee girl   but it is really about her nanny   shanta    shanta has a small circle of male admirers    two of the men are suitors   hasan   rahul khanna     a hindu   and dil navaz   aamir khan     a muslim    the others  sikh   hindu   muslim  are older   some are married   but all appreciate shanta   who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das       she also starred in deepa mehta s previous film   fire   the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water      in an early scene   the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny   political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears    one of the men remarks   jokingly   that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along    he is wrong   the men make barbed little comments to each other   spoken like jokes   but with an undercurrent of fanaticism    the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses    it is easy to perceive   in these squabbles   the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter    the group around shanta represents   in a sense   a united india   and shanta herself the ideal motherland  one which all love   which inspires hindu   muslim   and sikh to live peacably together    but the circle around shanta is sundered   as is the state    a sikh is persecuted   hides   then flees    another man is murdered    the group of friends will not meet again    the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction   a plate shattered on the floor   a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child   and   most brutally   when the tension escalates into violence   a man is held down   tied between two cars   and ripped in half by the op1ing movement of the vehicles    it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully    the crux of earth s plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz    his sisters are killed in brutal fashion   by hindus   because they are muslim    dil navaz seeks solace from shanta   and asks in desperation that she marry him    but she loves hasan   and tenderly refuses dil navaz s offer    the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him   and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality   the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate    despite the things he later does   it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him   but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things    the conclusion  the consequence of dil navaz s transformation  is rather abrupt    the story earth tells does not end    it just stops    it is an appropriate finish   giving us closure would have imparted   at least on an aesthetic level   a sense of resolution   of satisfaction    but there was no resolution for india and pakistan  they have been at war   on a small or large scale   for decades    since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation   it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus    there is no healing to be had   no closure   on any level   despite the needless   tacked on ending   with voice over narration from lenny as an adult   framing the story      earth is   in some ways   an unexceptional movie    it does not reinvent the wheel   following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas    but deepa mehta s directon is assured   and the issues she addresses run deep    earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou s to live and tian zhuangzhuang s the blue kite did for china   they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history    such films strike me as inherently valuable   even when flawed    they may be biased or inaccurate   but they bear the weight of human hardship   and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other   more inventive films   often lack    it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries   the events shown may have happened decades ago   but they still touch a nerve    the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year    in the near future   india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other    at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen   after seeing earth   i have a much   much better understanding    ,1
 up until about a year ago   john travolta s career consisted of those   look who s talking   movies   notice how they never called them look who s talented   and the 1991 bomb shout   which was bad enough to make most people scream      but somewhere along the line   travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again    weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again   while barry   robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight to the cutout bin album aptly named   size isn t everything     and of course   they learned that sales are everything      but now travolta s back on the hollywood scene once again   and i think we all know why    four words   contract with the devil    and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich s   contract with america      no   satan is much more humane    anyway   yes   travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld    how do i know    i own the document in question    amazing what you can buy at those collector s shops for a few hundred dollars   isn t it    get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction   with travolta as crime minion chili palmer    he goes to collect some of the mafia s money from a b grade director   gene hackman   and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game    sure   a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood   but i guess that s beside the point    palmer is determined to get hackman s next project made   so he sets out to convince big star martin weir   danny devito   to star in the movie   bringing along down and out horror actress karen flores   rene russo     who has already had affairs with hackman and devito    it doesn t take a las vegas odds maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well   after the customary sexual tension and denial   which has been used in every comedy from   who s the boss      to speechless    it works in this case   unlike   who s the boss      although it s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also    complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman s other films and want in on this one too   along with travolta s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting    get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction   despite the obvious similarities    this movie doesn t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i ve seen this year   yes   even better than halloween vi      get shorty is my kind of movie   one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence    i m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on    are you getting this   shorty    ,1
 i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory    this was   of course   a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this    not only did i get to see an advance screening   i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie    the very fast paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher   a fast talking   witty   comical taxi driver in new york city    gibson s performance is terrific   and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films    gibson again teams up with richard donner   as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick   and this time around   the combination works even better    the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique    try to imagine a toned downed version of travis bickle who   this time around   is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover ups    if you can imagine that   then you ve basically got jerry fletcher    in many ways   i was surprised by this movie    to begin with   i was surprised at how good it was    don t get me wrong   it s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring   but it was a very enjoyable movie    secondly   i was surprised at mel gibson s performance    he provided a fantastic performance    the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all out action flick   which after viewing   it was almost the op1ite in a certain sense    gibson s character has an almost uncountable number of one liners   hilarious situations   and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film    for instance   jerry s apartment   and especially his security   is memorable    and last   i was surprised at how good the plot is    writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story   and when watching this film   you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher s far fetched   or so they seem at first   conspiracy theories are helgeland s own opinions    mel gibson isn t the only stand out in the film    julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton   the department of justice employee who can t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher   who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories    he also seems obsessed and in love with her    but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories   she shrugs him and his beliefs off   continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him    jerry   obviously determined to continually seek out the truth   continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory   which will be printed in his newsletter   same title as the movie      although he only has five subscribers   he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work   and publishes his next edition    very soon after he does so   he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr   jonas   patrick stewart      after barely escaping alive   jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust   alice sutton    the remainder of the film is almost always fast paced and full of action and suspense   with jerry s life being constantly put into jeopardy    and more along the way   the audience   and alice   learn more and more about jerry s life    many things are explained throughout this film   both to the characters and to the audience    for instance   the meaning of the book   the catcher in the rye   and its ties to assassins   the reason lone gunmen have three names   e   g    lee harvey oswald and james earl ray     and the real truth behind the grateful dead    make sure listen closely throughout the film   as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above    definitely   when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th   make sure you are standing in line to see it    i am nearly 1itive everyone should enjoy this film   especially if you are into an action thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations    and even if you aren t   you should still like this film    ,1

 i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister    twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with    but twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano  volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo    he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter    there is one small quake then another quake    then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours    a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall    then         it  starts    the volcanic eruption          i liked this movie       but  it was not as great as i hoped    i was still good none the less    it had excellent special effects    the best view       the  helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos    also       there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting    so       it was good ! !  ,1

 the computer animated comedy   shrek   is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups    for children   it offers imaginative visuals   appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces   loads of action and a barrage of big laughs   including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances   apparently a requisite in contemporary family films      for adults   it s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids    all in all     shrek   is a snappy ride   although there are a couple of points i found disturbing    but first the basics    based very loosely on a 199-1 children s story     shrek   follows several momentous days in the life of the title character   a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using    shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp   until a local nobleman disturbs his peace    petty tyrant lord farquaad   take away the   awk   in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one liners   owns the land on which shrek resides    he proceeds to turn the ogre s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle    as a result   shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice   pinocchio   the big bad wolf   the seven dwarfs   and the three bears   to name but a few    an enraged shrek storms to the castle   only to find farquaad   john lithgow   ready to bargain    lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from   snow white   has shown him the way    all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife    the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of   the dating game     when snow white is shown   the cheeky announcer purrs     even though she lives with seven men   she s not easy !      farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona   cameron diaz   and offers shrek a deal   if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon protected   lava moat filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne   the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds    shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest   accompanied by a motor mouthed donkey   eddie murphy   determined to make the green grump his best friend    they finally hook up with the princess   only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet    for the matter   the dragon offers a few surprises as well    the movie references a great many other flicks   from   babe       that ll do   donkey    that ll do     to   the graduate      but the lion s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney    the public domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits   pinocchio is referred to as a   1sessed toy   and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin   he bellows     get that dead broad off the table !       but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad s royal domicile   which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom   from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like   it s a small world      which brings me to disturbing point number one    i laughed at all the disney swipes   but found the mentality behind them a bit sad    the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known    for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day    and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer    here s a suggestion for the two boys   grow up !  put the past behind you !  there s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can t play nice   then go to your rooms !  the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad    beyond all the irreverence     shrek   actually has a message   people should learn to look beyond physical appearances   because true beauty lies within    it s a lovely notion   but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad s diminutive stature    do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable    the pompous   selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers    adding short jokes is simply mean    still     shrek   is a rollicking good time    the computer animation is mostly impressive   although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky     the voice work is strong   particularly from eddie murphy     the laughs come fast and furious   and the moral   tainted though it may be   is a good one    to trot out a clich       shrek   is fun for all ages    parents   though   should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short   tall   skinny   fat   etc   is a bad thing    ,1
 after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film   you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again    there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles   as a master would teach an eager apprentice       you caress the noodles with the chopsticks     he says     then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying    see you soon        of course   it s meant to be a parody   but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety    you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat   not something you like   not something you enjoy   but rather something you experience    experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses   fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts    trust me   you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point    juzo itami s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western   set in modern day japan    a stranger   goro   tsutomu yamazaki     comes into town and finds tampopo   nobuko miyamoto     the proprietor of a small   hole in the wall noodle shop   trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman   pisken   rikiya yasuoka      goro   to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles   gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen   emerging bloodied   but victorious    goro finds that tampopo s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away   just to eat a bowl of her ramen    the problem is   her fare is something less than popular   and less than appetizing    however   goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest   and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert   enlist the aid of a wealthy patron   and make friends with the former enemy    this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems    take   for example   when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner    the price is too high   but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum    tampopo meets him at his store late at night   and he leads her to a back room    she protests   thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives   but he insists    just when she is about to bolt for the exit   he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door    she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day   her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience    this scene   while comical   is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation   then of relief and discovery    there s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who   despite their economic trappings   are all gourmets and master sommeliers    we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet    the scene is meant to bring a laugh   but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor   food is something which everyone has in common   and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all    there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film   which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people s lives    a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor    surrounded by her children   she is obviously in her last hours of life    her husband comes home   and seeing her worsened condition   demands that she get up and make dinner    the viewer knows the husband s intention is not to be mean   he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived   and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this    in a near miracle   the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal   then brings it to her awaiting family    as the family eats   she looks on them and smiles    preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her   and for a brief moment   she too enjoys the normalcy    then she falls over   dead    for a moment   the family is stunned   but then the father yells at the children     keep eating !  this is the last meal your mother ever made !    crying as they do so   the family finishes the meal    the scene is comical   awkward   moving   and beautiful    by including the vignettes   itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film   but surprisingly   they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline    instead   they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble    because the film parodies a western   the construction of the plot is fairly predictable   but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the   good guys   come together for the final showdown    in this case   the showdown is against the ramen    if they eat tampopo s ramen   soup and all   tampopo knows she has succeeded    it s pretty obvious what the outcome will be   but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life   you can afford to cut it a little slack    ,1
 there s an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last    george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy    return of the jedi   the final installment of the series   is easily the most innovative   action packed   and entertaining of the three films    the dark   eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone    instead   for return of the jedi   we have good triumphing decisively over evil   a resolution to a love triangle   and walking teddy bears    even darth vader doesn t seem very intimidating this time around    with the arrival of the emperor   an apparition like creature played by ian mcdiarmid     vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman    return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back    luke skywalker   mark hamill     princess leia   carrie fisher     lando calrissian     billy dee williams     chewbacca   peter mayhew     c3p-1   anthony daniels   and r2 d2   kenny baker   are on a rescue mission to luke s home planet of tatooine    their goal   to save han solo   harrison ford   from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt    it is at jabba s home   a creepy looking stone fortress guarded by hog nosed beasts   that most of the added special effects come into play    from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba s sand barge   the effects are top notch    as soon as han is freed from his cryo freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt   it s back to outer space   where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire s newest threat   a second   more powerful death star   that   if activated   could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor    so   while the fleet prepares for the final battle   luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks    there   they are befriended by the ewoks   the teddy bear like native race   and luke   fearing that his presence is endangering the group   turns himself over to vader    return of the jedi has some interesting elements    the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well acted    from a technical point of view   the space battles are amazing   easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films    not only are there many   many more ships   but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved    on one level   return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects    in the special edition   even more ships are added   making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch    the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films    by now   or then   1983     mark hamill   harrison ford   and carrie fisher have all matured in their on screen personas    the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific    as in empire   billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for    newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy   cunning   and evil creature   although he s not as im1ing as vader was in star wars    although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen   return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment    with the spectacular   new special effects   the adorable ewoks   the sinister jabba the hutt   the evil emperor   the same old millenium falcon   darth vader s incredible betrayal   the destruction of the new death star   and the always lovable yoda   return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang    congratulations to george lucas   whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come        ,1
 why do so many children s films treat their target audience with utter contempt    too many of those who write or direct for children s movies assume that the kids just can t handle serious   thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues       the iron giant     which was directed and co written by brad bird   late of such animated series as   the simpsons   and   king of the hill     assumes that not only can children handle such discussions   but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time       the iron giant   holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience   making it a film that s enjoyable for both children and adults alike    hogarth hughes   voice of eli marienthal   is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard working single mother   annie   jennifer aniston     in a small town in maine    after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away   hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception    he comes across a giant robot   vin diesel   from space that eats metal for food    after saving the robot   nicknamed the iron giant   from electric shock   hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts    because of damage he suffered upon landing   the giant has forgotten what his original mission was   so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy    realizing he can t just keep the giant in a barn all the time   and that the giant needs food   he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean   harry connick jr       an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time    it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can t keep the giant a secret forever   because a government spook named kent mansley   christopher mcdonald   has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security    he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant   and takes up residence in hogarth s house as a lodger    meanwhile   the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind       the iron giant   is exactly what family films ought to be   because it doesn  t talk down to its audience    the story is simple   very simple   about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy    it s very similar to the spielberg classic   e   t       and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of   the iron giant      the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg s film   such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy    the film delivers several serious messages   the most important of which is one s ability to choose one s own fate    hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be   a hero    the final sequence is touching and appropriate   though i won t give it away   i will say that very few will be disappointed    the animation   while not up to disney standards   what could be   after   tarzan         is good enough to make you forget you re watching a cartoon    the giant is computer animated   while the human characters are all hand drawn the old fashioned way    the characters  faces are done quite well   drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible   but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief    fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth   and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother    harry connick jr   does a nice characterization as dean   and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney   of tv s   frasier     as an army general called in by agent mansley    unlike several cartoon features   each character is actually a developed personality   rather than a stereotype   and is actually integral to the plot   rather than being a superfluous comic relief sidekick   a clich   disney still hasn t ditched      dean   for example   could have been a stereotypical beatnik   his character profile seems to suggest that     but he is presented as a character with real emotions   thoughts   and motivations    even the heavy   agent mansley   is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to   but out of his own fear and paranoia    a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper thin stereotypes and figure the kids won t mind   but   the iron giant   has clearly put a little work into making the characters real   and it pays off    the film isn t only around to deliver heavy handed messages   though    it s also very funny   and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy    the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things   such as dive into a pool   are handled well   and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing   having worked on   the simpsons   for many years    a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to   outlast   one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed   and also extremely clever    the film even takes some jabs at america s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war   satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to   duck and cover   in the event of a nuclear attack       the iron giant   has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films   and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing    instead of seeing people get bonked on the head   we get well timed   clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with    when you get right down to it     the iron giant   is no more than the story of a boy and his robot    the story is so straightforward   so quaint   that it ultimately becomes charming    though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person   when it comes to family entertainment   simple is the way to go    it s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word   but it s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind   but rather the elements that go into the story   namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue   which   the iron giant   has in spades    ,1

 roman emperor marcus aurelius   richard harris   chooses his trusted general maximus   russell crowe   as his successor    however the emperor s evil son commodus   joaquin phoenix   murders his father before the announcement can be made   and maximus   as well as his family   is sentenced to be executed    maximus is able to escape his executioners   but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo   oliver reed      proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money   he being a former gladiator himself     and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator    when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum   proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle    maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus    gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania   and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required   4-1 minutes of ex1ition after a kick ass opening sequence   style of moviemaking    the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used        it s choppy slow motion which is unsettling and distracting    it s similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan   but nowhere near as effective    the actual gladiator battles are thrilling   but also a bit disjointed    many times it s unclear as to exactly what s going on        all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled    we re not sure who s blood or by who s hand though    there s an instance of this earlier in the film too that s disappointing    it s comes when maximus escapes his executioners    some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free        but i still don t know exactly how he did it    russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995 s virtuosity    for whatever reason his stardom never arrived        but he should have it now    from here on moviegoers should now be able to say     let s go see the new russell crowe movie      he gets the best scene in the film   and one of the best moments of all recent movies   when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum    it s both rousing and chilling    joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character   which could have easily happened      commodus is conniving   sneaky and whiny   but phoenix never lets the character get silly    it s a very good   and very creepy   performance    oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator   and it s a huge loss to the acting world    i ve always been fascinated with reed        he s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years    it s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again   as he gives a fun and sincere performance    the film is dedicated to him   and he will surely be missed    reed s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem   as he still had scenes to be completed    rather than recast the role   and end up reshooting a great deal of footage     a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars    ironically   that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film    anyway   this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of   for about twenty seconds   and if you aren t looking for it you won t even be able to tell    some of the other digital effects are less convincing however        and like i always say   noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately    it s sad that such a good film has these distractions    movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects    keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events   but is entirely a work of fiction    however it s a work of fiction that s great entertainment   and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2-1-1-1 a   d    ,1

 you ve seen this moment before   recently   a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing    the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor s nell in the haunting   we don t care    the hero of the sixth sense   a young boy named cole   is a rich creation   and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike    the seasons have changed since an ex patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe   willis   in the comfort of his own bedroom    desperate to get his career back on track   even at the expense of his crumbling marriage   to williams   of rushmore     malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole   osment      the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm s would be killer   scars on his body   antisocial behaviour   and the reluctance to reveal a big secret    only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies   and hospitalized as a result   does he divulge to malcolm   in a spine tingling scene   that he sees dead people walking among us   all the time    malcolm assumes   and given his profession   reasonably so   that cole is schizophrenic   not psychic   but the sincerity in cole s anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures    he will instead pursue the supernatural angle   becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole   who lives with his single mother   lynn   collette     in the process    the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist       though shyamalan does   somewhat unforgiveably   crib the self rearranging kitchen business from the latter      it s far more heartwarming than frightening   and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks    cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown   but they re not out to harm him   really they just want to be heard   even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler    perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us   at first   than they really are because we re looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight year old    that s right   willis   for the first time in years   gives up the spotlight to his costar    we appreciate malcolm s domestic dilemma   but we identify with cole   recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed    both actors deliver immensely likable performances   and their dynamic is manifest    willis convinces us that he s a doctor   something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night    osment is phenomenal   a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do    the sixth sense   atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs  cinematographer   tak fujimoto   is actually a drama its spooky   effective ad campaign is misleading    only because i was expecting something different did i notice rather   feel the movie s running time   which is just shy of two hours    the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly   its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait    i m not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof   but i admired its audacity    ,1
 hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death   no pun intended   honest      it s a shame   too   because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b movie monsters    i mean   come on    are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour    hell no    and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell   but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well   not commonly associated with horror films    and not only has the idea been done too many times   but with the 1sible exception of from dusk  till dawn   has not been done very well lately   either    this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu    i got to go back to the times when making movies   even horror movies   was considered an art form   and not just done to make cash like nowadays    and that is exactly what this film is   art    i ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old   and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers    let me backtrack a minute    when i say   intellectual ground     i don t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that   i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to   a little bit of thinking is involved    with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what not   you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown    those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit   movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen    you see   this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore    this is a thinking man s slasher flick    the   nosferatu   of the title is orlock   max shreck     a strange   hermit like count that   as the film opens   is looking for a new home to buy    he employs the help of hutter   gustav von wangenhein     a real estate salesman   or something to that effect   who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen   greta schroeder      upon orders from his boss   hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock s castle and speak to him about his new home   which just happens to be right next door to hutter s      the next morning   he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck       not  really a good sign    he then discovers through some reading that the count is a   nosferatu     or vampire   one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans    but by the time he pieces this together   he is too late   orlock has already embarked to hutter s hometown via boat    will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock    the character of orlock is   of course   dracula    the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker s novel    just thought that was an interesting little side note        probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment s digitally restored cut   now available in stores    however   this version is quite different than maunau s original masterpiece    the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o -1ative and color tinting   much like the 1984 version of lang s metropolis    now   i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here   bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one    but alas   i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen    but that s just my bag   you may like the newer   more   modern   version better    either way   i suggest investing your money in a copy    if you like what they have done with it   pop it in the vcr and enjoy    if you re like me   just do what i ll do during future viewings   turn the color all the way down on your television   hit mute   turn on some bach or mozart or whatever   dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made    ,1
 stendhal s syndrome   a condition where   in the presence of art   a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression   suicidal behaviour and personality disorder    grim stuff   to be sure   but the subject of a remarkable film from italy s master of the horror thriller dario argento    boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone   the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento    it follows his disappointing american debut trauma   1992     the patchy opera   1987   and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 198-1 s    based on the novel by graziella magherini   the film stars argento s daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist killer    visiting florence to follow up several leads   she is lured by the killer alfredo   thomas kretschmann   to an art gallery   a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail    at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints    1ing as a bystander   alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer   a strange game of cat and mouse begins    a gripping story evolves   and a coherent one   too   which may surprise those familiar with argento s often lumpy narratives    the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop hunting killer scenario    it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character s psychological disintegration    the script explores its psycho sexual themes with intelligence and candour   perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers    but as dark as its themes are   the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years    argento is once again working in his native italy   and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences    effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here   and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent    the film s opening 2-1 minutes segues between hallucination   flashback and real time with tremendous style    proof that   at his most inspired   argento remains one of the world s most exhilarating filmmakers    the cast is generally good   though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless    asia argento s performance is by turns risky   awkward and fascinating    it s a difficult role   and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts    thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo   and marco leonardi   of cinema paradiso   and 1sibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy   does okay as anna s work colleague and increasingly confused love interest    but perhaps the stendhal syndrome s single most striking element is ennio morricone s soundtrack    active since the 196-1 s   morricone has scored over 1-1-1 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts    it s mostly a variation on the one theme   a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal 1sessed with an extraordinary   haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards    it s been three decades since argento and morricone worked together    this is a long welcome reunion    if the film has a fault   it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn t quite reach a completely satisfying climax    but by the closing scenes   the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento s career     * note   see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can    dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web    ,1

 zero effect gets its title from the main character   daryl zero   bill pullman     although we don t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film    zero is a private investigator   perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived   at least he d like to think so      however   he s a socially inept being   and eccentric in every 1sible way    this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are    zero s accomplice is steve arlo   ben stiller     a   normal   guy who does the business side of the job    he s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero s greatness as an investigator    the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero s talents to soon to be client gregory stark   ryan o neal      it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe de1it box   and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about    zero takes the case   and the plot thickens    his path leads to a young   pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan   kim dickens      despite her luminous and seemingly harmless presence   she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark    through his investigations   zero learns why   but not without developing feelings for gloria    feelings that   because of his reclusive behavior   are new and confusing to him    i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film    i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators   and   every once in a while   a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away   actually   no private eye film has ever reached chinatown s greatness      zero effect   which is jake kasdan s first effort as writer/director   is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts   it s an original   funny   and completely involving motion picture    with so many cliches available to this genre   i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them    but he didn t just successfully avoid flaws   he has created a great film here   one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment    take   for starters   the great cast of characters    pullman is terrific as zero   showing a comic flair that i really haven t seen from him since spaceballs    zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here   the fact that he s an almost exaggeratedly twisted   emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe    pullman s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance   and the occasional voice over as he s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious    ben stiller is also a very funny individual   he s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny       i ll shoot you     he says to stark at one point       i have a gun   and everything      his character is also well drawn   with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend   angela featherstone   who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job    o neal also gives his character a bit of depth   and kim dickens   last seen   and underused   in mercury rising   gets a chance to show us her talent here   giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs    i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film    kasdan s humor is of the best kind    soft spoken   and mostly dialogue driven   though there are some great visual jokes      it s the kind of humor that s funny even after you ve seen it five or six times    there s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is   an how that makes him such a great detective    what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed   or standing motionlessly   with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face   his eyes pointing to something off camera   but obviously to nothing in particular    i can t convey to you how funny this is   but what makes it great film making is that it has a point    scenes like this are frequent   and they provide solid characterization of zero    as a side note   i don t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy   not to sound elitist      i find things funny that many do not   and vice versa    there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film   and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it    i have a feeling the humor here won t appeal to everyone   but there s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone s interest    jake kasdan   son of writer/director lawrence kasdan   is only 22 years old    i found this out after seeing the film   and i can t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker    his direction is stylish without being pretentious   and his writing is mature   full   and developed    zero effect is the kind of film that i ll buy for my collection    smart   original films like this are rare as it is   but this one actually has a heart and a soul    at the end of the film   i was involved in the characters   and i was satisfied with the outcome    and   with kasdan s undeniable talent at such a young age   all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future    ,1
 the long kiss goodnight   r   meryl streep tried it and failed    even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well bared assets    however   geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight   a pre1terous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband   renny harlin    davis plays samantha caine   a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years    with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey   samuel l   jackson     she slowly remembers  and reclaims  her past as charly baltimore   tough as nails cia operative    needless to say   with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no goodniks out to erase more than her memory    shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script   i m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag   but for what it s worth   it delivers the goods    like black s previous work   such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout   the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny   quirky dialogue    the humor especially works well in this case   for the story is so pre1terous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously    but there s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell   who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car        while ice skating    jackson and davis make a good team    jackson is funny as ever as ever   in fact   his spirited line deliveries   especially when he first appears   are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction    as good as he is   the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis   who shows much promise as an action heroine    what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn t take herself too seriously    she is obviously in on the joke   slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation    this is not to say that she doesn t need work  sometimes she lays on the   toughness   a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature    but should the public embrace the film and   in turn   the notion of a kick ass female   davis could have found her special niche    it seems as if davis and harlin s first collaboration   the middling pirate epic cutthroat island   was just a dress rehearsal   albeit a very costly one   for long kiss   in which the wife husband team hit their action stride    anyone simply looking for a fun   escapist entertainment that requires little to no thinking will find this film to be a more than welcome kiss    ,1
 screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker    screenplay by andrew kevin walker    inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving    directed by tim burton    starring johnny depp   christina ricci   and casper van dien    special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken    synopsis   investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation    townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them    cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery    comments   tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years    batman   of course   is perhaps his best known film and led to a string of less successful sequels    he s done biographical work   on the director ed wood     children s movies   nightmare before christmas     and a homage to alien invasion movies   mars attacks !      sleepy hollow   his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while   shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies    sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 195-1s and 196-1s   especially hammer studios  reworkings of dracula and frankenstein   and american international s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe    christopher lee   in fact   star of many hammer productions over the years   appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders    the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 193-1s    one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein    i mention these allusions for a reason    seasoned horror film fans   including myself   will smile at their inclusion in this film    with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies   especially the blair witch project   the most overblown turkey of the decade     we needed a film like this    not only does it have a sense of history   but burton s skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror    the film s eerie landscapes and foggy towns   indeed   overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie    johnny depp   a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands   plays ichabod crane   who has apparently changed occupations from irving s original story and is now an investigator    depp is adequate in his role    no more   no less    equally adequate is christina ricci   who plays the love interest in the film    she s a good witch too    how cute    one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters    the two actors   however   carry the movie well enough   but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine    veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough   who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks   are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers    while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points   i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing    you have to pay attention    andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay    he s the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven    walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood   and sleepy hollow certainly doesn t hurt his growing reputation    as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker   sleepy hollow is quite graphic    there s a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings    this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to    a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25   3-1 minutes covering the youngest s eyes with her hand    he was obviously upset by the movie s intense violence    if you re looking for a good scare   however   sleepy hollow is definately recommended    ,1
 mpaa   not rated   though i feel it would likely be pg   for martial arts violence      with three movies already   re   released theatrically in america   and at least three more on their way   jackie chan is one of the newest   hot properties   in action adventure stardom   and it s just about time    for over twenty five years   jackie s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong   thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy       drunken master   has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to   make it big     this is the movie that sup1edly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong    i m not entirely sure why   exactly    in many ways     drunken master   is similar to most of jackie s other early films   such as   fearless hyena   i and ii     master with cracked fingers       half a loaf of kung fu       spiritual kung fu     and others    in fact   looking at all these early films together   one gets the impression that they were stamped out   cookie cutter style   at a rate of four to six per year   all using the same casts and telling very similar stories    to be honest   i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste    they re quite different from action movies as we know them in america    these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past   with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together       drunken master     though its plot is tighter than some   is no exception       as an aside     drunken master   was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw   and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen       in  a movie theater in seattle   as part of an asian film festival    at the time   i didn t really think it was anything special       but  after having seen more films like it   it s kind of grown on me         drunken master    s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies   such as   fearless hyena   i and ii and   master with cracked fingers     slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh seeming master   and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end   a formula that has been   adapted     to put it kindly   by american films such as karate kid      more specifically   jackie chan plays the part of wong fei hong   aka   naughty panther     a fun loving   practical joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good   but not  quite  good enough    after embarrassing his instructor s assistant by beating him roundly   then beating up a bully in a marketplace   wong fei hong tries to hit on a pretty girl   but discovers that she   and her mother   can hit back   better than he can       and  is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt   respectively    his father   wong kei ying   is unhappy about this   and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages    kei ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment   which fei hong does not like at all    while escaping from this punishment   fei hong meets up with a drunken old man   who proceeds to thrash him soundly   then take him on as a student and thrash him some more    this turns out to be su hua chi   a legendary master of drunken style kung fu    he assigns fei hong a series of bizarre tasks   such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame   cracking walnuts with his hands   and other such exercises   that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up    then   when he s ready   he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu    unfortunately   the lazy fei hong only practices six of them           drunken master   features some wonderful martial arts sequences   with jackie winning some fights and losing others    it s been said before   but i ll say it again  these fights don t just  happen    they re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance   and it shows    in his fights   jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment   benches   jugs   cups   bowls   fruits and vegetables  often in new and surprising ways    the fight scenes   particularly those toward the end of the film   are unparallelled in most american films    whether jackie wins or loses   it s really something to see       and  it s often as funny as anything   too    and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very   very good at    there s very little that s new in this movie  jackie winning fights   jackie getting beaten badly by a master   jackie going through punishment or training       these  schticks have all been seen before   in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties    but they re still hilarious as ever    likewise   jackie has a  great  supporting cast   many of whom were also in other early jackie films   and they re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own    the really big thing about   drunken master     though   that inspired several copycats   including a couple starring jackie himself   and a sequel fifteen years later   was the drunken style kung fu    i m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu   but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security       and  it apparently helps if you re drunk while you re doing it    genuine or not   i have to admit   there s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what s going on    come to think of it   perhaps this element is what accounts for this film s success over any of the other jackie films       it s  not just martial arts   it s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go     whoa          on the -1ative side   the cinematography in this film is nothing special   the film stock is rather primitive   the plot is often rather slow   and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background       gone with the wind     this isn t    still   if you like martial arts films   or like what you ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more   give it a shot    it s much more   real   than chuck norris or jean claude van damme    you might very well like it    another interesting thing about   drunken master   has to do with its video availability in the us       drunken master   is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original   letterboxed   hong kong subtitled form   commercially available on vhs   from magnum video   in a gold box   for about $1-1      there are plenty of other early jackie films around   but these are typically either in dubbed   pan and scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase    thankfully     drunken master     at least   is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen   at a very affordable price    if you like   drunken master     take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there   even the dubbed ones aren t really  too  bad       if  nothing else   you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue      i particularly recommend   spiritual kung fu       half a loaf of kung fu     the   fearless hyena   movies   and   snake & crane arts of shaolin      also   the mostly unrelated storywise sequel     drunken master ii     will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year   though what its american release title will be is still uncertain   and comes  highly  recommended by this reviewer    also   for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei hong   who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore     i ve been told to suggest the   once upon a time in china   series starring jet li   though i haven t personally seen any of them yet      if you choose to watch   drunken master     i really hope you enjoy it   and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that s out there    all in all   i give this film an    ,1
 well   i know that stallone is 5-1 years old now   but in daylight he doesn t look it !  daylight is a great disaster movie    if you ve seen cliffhanger   you ll know stallone s character already    a guy with a bad past   but is in the right place at the wrong time    a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste    a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball   and what a fire ball it was !    stallone   a former emergency medical service man   is chauffeuring a rich couple around   when they reach the outside of the tunnel   before the explosion    then   3-1 minutes into the movie   boom !  >from here on   the plot takes a back seat   and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged    most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat    there are a few melodramatic parts here   but   they tend to work out well    there is no general antagonist in this film   but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that    daylight is a great film   i saw a non matinee showing of it   and i thought it was worth every penny    the characterizations are mostly flat   one dimesional   but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters    rob cohen   dragonheart   does a great job with this film    ,1
 logical time travel movies are a near im1sibility    considering that the skeptic s best argument against the 1sibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities   writing a script that deals with this problem is an im1ing task    occasionally   we get a film that does manage it    terry gilliam s   12 monkeys   was one such film    but more frequently   we get films that don t much deal with it at all    there is one question to ask in this case   does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies    the   terminator   films made up for them with exciting action     back to the future   did it with an entertaining story   and the new film   frequency   pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own    is   frequency   filled with plot holes    yes    does it matter    not really    the film opens in october of 1969    firefighter frank sullivan   dennis quaid   puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job   then goes home to his loving wife julia   elizabeth mitchell   and son johnny   daniel henson      the double pronged story flashes forward to 1999   where johnny   now jim caviezel   is all grown up and working as a police detective    a strange occurrence    the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city    allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in  69 and that john has found in the present day    though both are initially skeptical of the idea   john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire   and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom    now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive   john is initially overjoyed   until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous   a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women    frank and john now must work together to set things right   with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past    the premise of   frequency   is unusual   and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept   john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions    this isn t explained   you just have to go with it    when frank doesn t die in a fire   john is the only one who remembers it differently   while everyone else remembers it the new way    the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities    1969 and 1999    are to each other    sometimes frank s changing the past results in something happening right away in john s world   and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time    now   the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this   and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted   but nevertheless logical   if i thought about it hard enough   for example   the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer s murders was because the change had already happened in frank s world   and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change     but explanations aren t really the point    when   frequency   gets cooking   it s a riveting little thriller   even if it is confusing    what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment   and   frequency   works as long as it keeps moving    the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion    director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure   frequency   as good hollywood entertainment   establishing decent   likable characters   making us care for them   and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved    i liked many of the creative touches   the split screens   allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities   and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward    it actually uses the 1969 mets orioles world series   the one that featured the amazin  mets   to great effect    frank uses john s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him       admittedly   this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself      i even liked the final scene   which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods    some may find this scene blindingly confusing   as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious   but it does make sense if you think about it   and give the script a lot of leeway     and let s face it   it s a darn cool way to end the film    there are enough surprises and plot twists in   frequency   to keep you on your toes   and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant    the other major thing to appreciate about   frequency   is the handling of the father son relationship    quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily   it s a rock solid job from both actors    the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept   how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative   or with a future descendant    watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question    the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film   if we don t believe in the characters   we don t care about the outcome of the thriller plot    here   we do care   because we like the lead actors    i also liked some of the supporting cast members    elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles   playing julia the doting wife * and * mother   but still performs admirably    andre braugher   late of the television show   homicide   life on the street     gives a nice supporting turn as frank s best friend and future colleague of john    he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank s world series predictions come true before his very eyes    braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here   simultaneously dismayed and amused    perhaps the only thing i didn t like about   frequency   is the overly sentimental coda   during which the camera s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard    but that s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics    i freely acknowledge that   frequency   may best work as a   guy   movie   since it focuses on the very male oriented idea of father son relationships   echoes of   field of dreams   can be easily heard     but the underlying concept is universally applicable    who wouldn t want to speak with a long dead parent    or see how their children turn out       tell me about your life   son      excuse me while i mist up    and don t call me a sissy    ,1
 blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood s premier leading men    blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it    it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well    although   at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as op1ed to a movie    the ideas behind blade are good   as is the basic plot of the story    but at times   things seem to get a bit muddled   and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once    that really doesn t take away from the story too much   but it does hurt it a little bit    blade   snipes   is half man   half vampire    his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire    including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust    blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother    but this isn t as easy as it seems   because the vampires in blade s world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films    the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires   but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires    where do vampires get money    well   in blade   they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations    i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea   and a great addition to the movie    blade runs up against the evil deacon frost   stephen dorff   a maverick in the vampire community    he isn t content to live among humans   and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority    he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all powerful vampire    rendering him virtually unstoppable    it s up to blade to see that this doesn t transpire    admittedly   blade is style over substance through and through    the story is a relatively forgettable one   but it is fun none the less    the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type    this isn t a film that is going to win accolades for its performances   and the actors know this    the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise    it s a popcorn movie   and no one involved has any illusions otherwise    blade s production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster    the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done    although   the mtv style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences    blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre    this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle    what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life    very cool    ,1
 the truman show   paramount pictures   running time   1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait   jim carrey s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen    in case you ve been asleep for the last few months   the plot centres on truman burbank   carrey   who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven    his life seems so perfect   however   because it s controlled by christoff   harris   creator of the truman show   the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of    that s right   burbank s life is being broadcast live to the american public   and seahaven and all it s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage    the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far        with an idea so different   it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator    luckily   the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages   yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie    talking of carrey   he s perfect in this movie   enjoying the best role in his career    his character is a re inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask   1994   and is completely suited to carrey s persona    he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode   shrieking and being silly   but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey    he s not completely dramatic like the film promises   however    ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff   the megalomaniac creator of the show    quiet and well spoken   he burns an image into the viewer    unfortunately   he s barely in the film   and for the first hour dosen t appear at all !  also disappointing is natascha mcelhone s character sylvia    she plays the role well   but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her    the supporting cast is excellent   and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect   so perfect it s creepy    the philip glass soundtrack is also superb   and is used to great effect during the film    peter weir keeps the film going   clearly having fun    the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card    although it is slightly slow to begin with   about half an hour into film the pace really picks up   and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll    sadly   though   the film is practically over when the film is in full steam    also   concerning the ending   it is slightly too ambiguous   which was disappointing    the screenwriter   andrew niccol   who bought us gattaca   1997   delivers an entertaining script   and manages to keep the plot in trim    while christoff s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly   they never go over the line   which would have been easy for niccol to do    also   there s some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show    overall   the truman show is excellent entertainment    certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces   it should be viewed by everyone    it offers something to every member of the audience   and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed    overall rating=  review by david wilcock   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes  ,1
 no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan s harrowing   humorous   horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe s novel about young lad francie brady s   eamonn owens   descent into madness in 196-1s ireland    on one hand   it was difficult for me to become invested in francie s story because he is such an unsavory character   unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs   nugent   fiona shaw      on another hand   i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick   needy child   having been raised by a drunken father   stephen rea   and a suicidal mother   aisling o sullivan      on yet another hand   i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his   for lack of a better word     bad   deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them    however   the butcher boy s power is undeniable   and the film as a whole is unforgettable  perhaps because it is so disturbing    what makes it so unsettling is the francie s overall wink wink yet matter of fact attitude about everything   expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie   rea again      think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs   and you ll sort of understand    anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens   love francie or hate him   you cannot take your eyes off of owens    the butcher boy truly is a twisted   unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable    in the lobby after the screening   i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was   i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust     that movie was so unfunny !       i didn t know what to expect    it s like something you chase for so long   but then you don t know how to react when you get it    i still don t know how to react        michael jordan   on winning his first nba championship in 1991       or    my thoughts after meeting him on november 21   1997  ,1
 just how inseparable is the team of sgt    martin riggs   mel gibson   and sgt    roger murtaugh   danny glover      let s just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road   flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction   his partner actually does it !  the familiar lethal weapon family is back   including rene russo   who is now the expectant mother of riggs  child and joe pesci as the soprana like   foul mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye    new to the team is chris rock   also a fast talking   up and coming detective    trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go   and in this film   that is no exception    even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride   they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship    we here some ominous music   which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen    gunfire ensues   and when it s all over   the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord    although they don t know what they re looking for   their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action    and there s plenty of action here for two movies    led by fighting sensation jet li   whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive   he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to    li is ruthless in his approach   will kill anyone just to make a point   and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives    there are terrific car chases   explosions and gunshot galore    it s a summer action recipe followed to the letter   and the result is nothing less than pure   unadulterated summer fun    but even too many explosions can get boring    to counter that   we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li    luckily   he d rather fight hand to hand instead of firing off guns    meanwhile   when the detectives aren t reloading their guns or running from fireballs   they re engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets    everybody gets in on the shtick    russo screams during her delivery   the crime lord has a few funny bits when he s being interrogated while being given laughing gas   and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones    gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano    score one for the old guard    ,1
 since 199-1   the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style    now   instead of emphasizing feel good stories replete with characters of noble virtues   the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow    this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times   as 1993 s schindler s list shows    most of today s mainstream drama   however   creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience    that s why pictures like october sky   which are a throwback to the good ol  dramas of yesteryear   are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema    the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam   jake gyllenhaal     a teenager in the 195-1 s company town of coalwood   west virginia    it s a well known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships   the rest grow up to work in the coal mine    the mine   which is run by homer s father   chris cooper     is not the place for homer   however    after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957   homer feels a connection with the outside world    as he puts it     anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did      drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast   homer begins to construct rockets    with the help of their history teacher   miss riley   laura dern     and several mine workers   the four are soon bound for great things    october sky is a skillfully crafted film   and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston    johnston    whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars    certainly knows what he s doing here    he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust    he does not push any barriers   but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film s charm    his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost    such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers   or the silent struggle between homer s mother and father    the cast is well chosen   although the true bright spots are the supporting roles    laura dern   jurassic park   lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher   giving the boys the support and guidance they need    her role is instantly likeable    chris cooper   the horse whisperer     as homer s father   is less likeable    even downright despicable at times    but his turn here gives gravity to the movie    he s definitely a driving force in homer s life   and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable    the script is generally cheerful   projecting the boys  endeavors in a lighthearted manner    there are moments when it becomes predictable    such as the train tracks scene    and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist    it highlights the essence of youth   however   and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps    october sky should be a success with audiences    although it doesn t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she s all that   it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards    it s a welcome change to the dramatic genre   and one that everyone should see    ,1
 a big surprise to me    the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the im1sible off   but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues   john belushi   is such a dumb idea i really had no hope    they replaced him just fine    not with john goodman   he didn t do much of anything   but with the brilliant actor joe morton   who can really sing    the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant   who s ten    this was another of my fears for the film   but he s a really good dancer   and plays a mean harmonica   although he may have been dubbed      things that intellectually had bothered me before   like no mission from god   everyone being richer   it not being filmed in chicago    gave me no problems at all    i m quite pleased that there were less car pile ups   because they meant less music   and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing    there s a few early crashes   and then one huge pile up   but after that it all stops    it s just the music    one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him   but there s no problems with this    the music is all as good as ever   tons of great musicians showing up    with the exception of johnny lang   who can t sing   all the musicians do a great job    the only real problems i had was the special effects    these were superfluous and a waste of money    since the film isn t doing very well   they could mean we have no 1sibility of another sequel   which i want to see    the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide       http   //www   geocities   com/hollywood/academy/8-134/  remove no spam to reply       drive carefully but recklessly     mama   child s toy   the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise      peter o toole  ,1
 after having heard so many critics describe   return to me   as an old fashioned hollywood romance   i kept asking myself going into this movie   what exactly is an old fashioned hollywood romance    what made   return to me   old fashioned and old hollywood    was it the tunes from sinatra   etc     legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on    was it the glamorous   sophisticated feel    the charisma of the two leads    even now i can t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer   because i haven t see that many old fashioned hollywood romances    i don t think any of the romances i ve seen have been classified as such    which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics      return to me   was old fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic   the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider    it was traditional   magical    we knew it couldn t be too daring   or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in    it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity   tenderness   and love   from director bonnie hunt   that it couldn t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings    the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt s direction    from the very first bird s eye view of chicago   zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland   david duchovny     accompanied by the   return to me   ballad   by whom       we can tell we re in for something sweet    the scenes between the characters are endearing   truthful   with just a hint of fantasy    real people don t act that way   real people aren t that nice    we know all this   and yet we want to believe in these folks  existence    the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale   but hunt s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal    everything is ordinary  yet beautiful  in this film    >from the festive little family restaurant to grace   minnie driver   and bob s wardrobes    from the eloquent   not in a hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints    from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen    the most beautiful part       return to me   has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family   the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist    we care for them   laugh with them   cry with them   we re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father    whatever hunt did   she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors    disappointingly   david alan grier s charlie   however much i like him   was the most flatly written    duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona    with the help of his fellow co stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder    instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of   the x files      duchovny   who is excellent at understatement and self deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen    minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet   innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer    though an unlikely pair   duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses    while   return to me   functions remarkably as a laugh out loud comedy   a romantic scenic tour through chicago   and a tearjerker   the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop    the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife s heart    we already know that there s going to be a happy ending   we feel like we spend the entire film   however enjoyably   in a straight line going towards that point    as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly  yes   i know she s sup1ed to have his ex wife s heart and everything  it seems too effortless    the main subject is a love story   and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters   whose story might not have that much meat after all      however   in the spirit of   return to me     it won t do to be too picky about how   old   hollywood tells its stories    i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt    it shows    the bottom line     return to me   is nothing remarkable   and yet its sweetness   sincerity   and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn t imagined    ,1
 wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon   denise richards   and neve campbell that deals with all the issues   sex   love   murder   and betrayal    the setting of the film is a town named blue bay    it consists of many swamps and slums and   on the other hand   rich estates owned by the town s different benefactors    the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town s ritzy   expensive high school    it is here that we meet all of the core characters    there s guidance counselor sam lombardo   police officers ray duquette and gloria perez   dark mysterious senior suzie toller   and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan    we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor   but none more than kelly    throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape    shortly after   suzie   too   confesses that sam raped her as well    this pushes kelly s sex craving mother   sandra   to stop at nothing until sam is convicted    during the trial   kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her    however   it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls   it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor    after sam is cleared   kelly s mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her    it is then revealed that sam   kelly   and suzie were all in on it together    it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda    matt dillon stars as sam lombardo    sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into   and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage    he isn t the obvious best of actors   but dillon does give a convincing performance    however   his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film   making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles   although he never had many to start out with in the first place    neve campbell   who most people relate to scream and scream 2   plays blue bay outcast suzie toller    suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film    campbell is very successful with this character   adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch    playing kelly van ryan is denise richards    kelly is your typical   rich   sexy   head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses   like her sexpot mother sandra    one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother    denise richards   still hot off the press from starship troopers   gives the most interesting performance in the entire film    in the beginning   kelly looks to be a paper thin character   but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy   but dominating as well    kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette    this character looks to be one of the most boring   predictable in the film    however   it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story    still   the film doesn t seem to gain much from bacon s performance   only his name    in the supporting cast   theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan   daphne rubin vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez   and bill murray shines as sam s lawyer   ken bowden    hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film    although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller   the eroticism   which is portrayed with good taste   is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters    this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it s share of twists    ,1
  * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *  the previous two   alien   films have each had their own unique styles to them    the ridley scott s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film    james cameron s aliens was much more of an action film    and i liked each film separately for which it was    now alien 3 is out    and it is it s own film in the same right that alien and aliens were    unlike aliens   alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens    this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off    the survivors of the expedition to lv 426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens    the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item   an egg    in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch   find its quarry   which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured   an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel    this vessel crash lands on fury 1-19    everyone in the vessel is killed   except ripley    the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash    fury 1-19 is an ex mining/maximum security prison    when closed down   some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet    all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years    ripley s arrival sparks a problem with the inmates    as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner s sport   there is an infestation of lice on the planet    being an ex prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons    so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own    i will not go into detail   but you can guess what happens here    the alien is loose and no one believes ripley s outstanding story    she finds comfort in the arms of the colony s doctor    yes   after 57 years ripley has sex    it is not gratuitous   in fact   we don t even see them kiss   but it is just as well    a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film    there is a lot more gore in alien 3    in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two    it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !  i won t say how   but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle   which i am sure will be explored in alien 4    sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character    her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination    the rest of the cast is also quite good    notably   charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 1-19    alien 3 has a very distinct look    this is due largely to its director   david fincher    mr   fincher   who until now has only directed music videos and commercials   has done an incredible job here    his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no   alien   film has before    for mr   fincher   i see a long prosperous career ahead of him    the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry    elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the   alien   series been set in    this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii   james horner s aliens      this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring    this is a great score    the ending to alien 3 is quite good    there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up   but it played very nicely    i will not ruin the ending for you    go see the film    i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season    alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien    and when they make alien 4   perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in    ,1

 many people dislike french films for their lack of closure    while 1sibly shallow   i ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany   or at least a resolution   in the films which i view    there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional   however   the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion denying protagonist   stephane   daniel auteuil      stephane   daniel auteuil   is a master violin maker    he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing    even the relationship between he and his boss   maxime   andre dussollier   is a controlled   and almost manipulated association   highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches    in the beginning of the movie   stephane is a closed   solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man    camille kessler   emmanuelle beart   is a master violinist and the new love of maximes    maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife    like stephane   camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved   sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges    when stephane and camille meet   there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals    however   whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane   stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him    stephane ignores his feelings for camille   which the audience cannot help but to see is present    as the movie progresses   the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another    these two people   with very similar approaches to life initially   react to their new circumstance very differently    stephane becomes even more rational and controlled   while camille becomes more tempestuous   until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship    however   their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation    the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well   due to his relationship with a master violin teacher    however   apparently   he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing    consequently   stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays    in contrast   camille had almost given the violin   years earlier    however   with the aid of her manager   she has progressed to being almost one of the world s finest   successfully submerging herself to her playing    during the course of the movie   we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions    stephane attempts to remain unchanged    however   we do see subtle hints of his transformation    one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash    the development of all of the characters   many of which is not included in this synopsis   is incredible    american movies   with rare exceptions   have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development    in its essence   this movie is about the development and growth of the characters   camille and stephane    the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie   including a death   is to further the development of camille s and stepahne s characters    i am not sure why berardinelli says     at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified   and it is to auteuil s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty      this movie is not about judging stephane s actions as being right or wrong   but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are    i find the ending appropriate   unfortunately   i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling    this portion of the film is where the   sense of closure   could have been successfully accomplished    unfortunately   there is a hurried and almost a soap opera type surge of emotions from all of the characters    while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart   ravel has his day in this film    the synergism of the tension of ravel s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen    the directing in this movie is wonderful    the actors and actresses are excellent   each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth    emmanuelle beart s personality is beautiful    and needless to say   i must say that emmanuelle beart   herself   is beautiful    besides the near ending   the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral    i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of    the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot   has their attitude towards love changed    i have several 1sibilities which i believe the movie hints at   but i am unsure of which the director is espousing    in summary   this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship    in the process   we see their attitude towards life and other people    in itself   i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie    where it does become complicated is when we juxta1e the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we   as americans   have preconceived american notions of relationship   love   and people    i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture    however   i   bringing my american preconceptions   enjoyed the film    i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it    ,1
 the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber   the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse   and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest   little caper adventure entitled `where the money is      the elderly bank robber is henry   paul newman     a famous criminal that was only recently caught    he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune    always the shrewd thinker   he begins working on a plan to get out of jail    this involves years of studying buddhism and self hypnosis    when he is prepared to execute his plan   he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke    now a seemingly twitching vegetable   he is temporarily transferred to a state run home    carol   linda fiorentino   is the nurse that cares for him    she s a very bright person with a good heart    yet   her life is a miserable waste of time    the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars    her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics    worse   she s in a dead end relationship with high school sweetheart wayne   dylan mcdermott      they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom    to her   this made sense long ago    but now   it s a different story    wayne seems equally bored with his life   but is content enough to stay put    wayne s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman    carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients   but she s never been anywhere else and doesn t see many other opportunities in life    however   when henry falls under her care   her outlook begins to change    the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke    carol   however   begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all    maybe she can get through to him   and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away    the opening 3-1 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry   back to life      and what are some of carol s resuscitation techniques    perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses    if that fails   maybe she ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 2-1 foot high pier into the cold lake below    when he finally comes out of his state of self trance   the movie s direction changes   though it remains equally if not more entertaining    carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self assuredness    she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy    this   of course   puts wayne in an odd situation    henry and carol s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car    henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash    meanwhile   this is carol s ticket to a better life    wayne is uncomfortable with the situation   but helps out nonetheless    however   his lack of commitment threatens their success    the heist sequence is suspenseful   well paced   and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong    `where the money is  does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist    newman is the real joy of the film   adroitly showing that at age 75   he s still really hot stuff    he 1sesses a sly smile   displays a dominating attitude   and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive    fiorentino is also a fun presence    you root for her despite her sense of amorality    sure   she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair stricken man into a lake   but we can see that to escape her dead end world   she needs to do something drastic    with two charismatic characters such as these   it s hard to ignore that `where the money is  is where the fun is    ,1
 robert benton has assembled a stellar   mature cast for his latest feature   twilight   a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood    paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross    harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames   gene hackman and susan sarandon     a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight    when jack sends him on a routine delivery job   however   the old instincts kick in    soon   harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line   and he no longer knows who to trust    there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight   in addition to newman   hackman and sarandon    james garner plays raymond hope   a former cop and one of harry s best friends    stockard channing plays verna   harry s former partner   and 1sibly a former love interest    reese witherspoon is mel   the distrustful daughter of the ames    and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend    giancarlo es1ito appears as harry s bumbling detective protigi   and john spencer is a suspicious police captain    with a cast like that   it s almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze    luckily   there s more to the film than some sort of actor s recognition ceremony    twilight has a solid film noir ish plot    it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics   but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days    the major cast members all deliver strong performances   as can be expected of their caliber    however   none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable    the supporting cast is enjoyable   if a little underdrawn    stockard channing s character   in particular   is a cipher    there s more to her character than the film takes the time to describe    it s a minor   but irritating   flaw    with a solid cast   and a good plot   there s a lot to recommend about twilight    it s biggest flaw is actually its short running time    at a slim 94 minutes   there s a lot of stuff that s packed into an awfully small package    still   the chance to see newman   sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two    ,1
 warning   anyone offended by blatant   leering machismo had better avoid this film    or lots of blood & guts   men against men and mano et mano stuff    in other words   it s a walter hill film !  with a john milius script !  i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm wrestling matches    these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with   probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb    and we got tough guys galore   here   drug running banditos by the dozens   all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill tempered   overall   a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover up   sup1edly   any connection between the government and the drug runners   and lots of shit kicking texas dirt farmers who d as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you    in particular   we got nick nolte as one hard ass texas ranger   powers boothe as the drug kingpin   michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army   and rip torn as the local sheriff    torn is the sympathetic figure of the group   he smiles before shooting anyone    as to women        well   i ve never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film   and at this rate   i doubt i ever will    women exist here to look good   comfort the man   and get argued over    gosh !  just like the old days        frankly   this is a pretty good movie   if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff    the cinematography is excellent   the cast of characters is broad and has texture   the script is quite good   and the film lets you keep up with what s happening yourself   without spelling it out to you    i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up    finally   there s lots of sam peckinpah slow motion shoot ups    ,1
 accepting his oscar as producer of this year s best picture winner   saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over    one could almost say the same about his much prized film    rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery   symbolism   ideas and metaphors   complex and literate storytelling   all 1sessed of an intelligence that invites    even demands    constant scrutiny   an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth    in short   the antithesis of all things hollywood    yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind    ralph fiennes is the title character   an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory   and particularly the memory of love   is the ostensible focus of the film    but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together   we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him    his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld    the same can easily be said for every other character in the film   of which there are too many    juliette binoche s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart    at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her   and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious   disfigured   dying stranger    even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion   however   that it verges on the comical    with so many characters enjoying so little screen time   the film s 16-1 minutes can be taxing    yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn t help but feel that greatness was in the air    hints of it were everywhere    in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to 1sess his lover   in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern day swimmer in the sahara   in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war    there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years    but ultimately the emotional truths writer director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed    in the end   i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron   a haunting bore    bore is perhaps too strong a word    but after drinking in the rich production values   the cup remains only slightly over half full    ,1
 a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates   a film which was based on the best seller by george v     higgins    it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51 year old   small time hood   eddie   fingers   coyle   mitchum      he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment    his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3 5 year stretch in new hampshire   something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn t think he could survive prison at his age    he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare    he could have cut a deal and gotten off   if he turned his boss over to the d   a     but he figured he would never live if he did that    he is currently gun running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise   rocco      the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager s house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it    on one of the heists   they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm    coyle s best friend is dillon   boyle     a hit man for the mob   working as a bartender    he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents   as an aggressive young agent named foley   jordan     who likes to be called uncle   gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record   as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs    with the sentencing date closing in on him   the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time    he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain    thinking he made an iron clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire   he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down   knowing full well the young hustler   keats   selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence    but foley tells him after he arrests the gun dealer   that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence   they want him to be a full time informer    warning   spoiler follows in next paragraph    the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend    the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up    coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says     to be young like that and have his future   he s the greatest hockey player in the world      dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob style   having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston    this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets   of the hopeless situation the low level criminals are in   and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next    the city streets are ugly   the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests   whether it is betrayal or murder    there is a fatalistic feel about their lives   something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat    mitchum gives this film all the intensity and pur1e it needs   as it overcomes a thin plot    it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them    mitchum is a loser   and   that he lived so long   is a tribute to his skills as a survivor    but in the end   he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy   as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle    ,1
    footloose   has only one goal in mind   to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel good antics    and i hate to admit it   i fell for it    the movie is about a teenager   bacon   who moves to a small town from the big city   and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend   lithgow      he ends up falling for the preacher s daughter   singer   and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do    as mentioned at the beginning of this review     footloose   is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama    there are virtually no surprises   and the writing is second rate    so why did i enjoy it so much    for one thing   the cast is great    kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role    we re rooting for him right from the start   and   unlike most films of this genre   bacon doesn t play him as the   rebel without a clue   sort    yes   he does rebel   but he s also polite when he needs to be    and he never broods    the rest of the cast is equally impressive    john lithgow   seen here playing a normal guy for a change   is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian    but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter    by the end of the film   we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character    another nice touch is the music    we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with   sexual innuendos     but that s not true at all    the title track   performed by kenny loggins   is upbeat and fun    during the final sequence   i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing    of course   i soon realized that would be a little pathetic    anyway     footloose   is a charming little surprise    don t let the premise prevent you from watching it    it sucked me in   and it ll do the same to you    ,1
 as i walked out of crouching tiger   hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film    with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a   great   piece of work and viceversa    attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs    i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology    as the word implies   a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master    as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality    crouching tiger   hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category    crouching tiger   hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore   with the requisite blend of legend   fantasy   magic and mythology    it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half gods   greater than life   purer than life   stronger than life   physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats   but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable    all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix   including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement    the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop   with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil   which must choose between the two    it is the gifted pupil who   under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend    the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment   a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters   are poignantly represented    the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively    the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours de force   not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art   as are the prodigious leaps and flights to   from and between rooftops   the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake    there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry    as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line   which takes place at an ordinary human level   yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy    do not assume   however   that the art is limp wristed    for those who are put off by the   art   label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure   action and romance    there are no weak performances in this movie    michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth   humanity and wisdom    chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart    zhang ziyi is a budding superstar    she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role    cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably    kudos to screenwriters james schamus   wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing   choreographer yuen wo ping   photography director peter pau and music director tan dun   each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film    ang lee as the director   co producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit    this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes   including those who hate martial arts movies    don t miss it    ,1
    crazy/beautiful   suffers from the damned if you do   damned if you don t syndrome    after a spate of flighty   cookie cutter teen films   the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story    but rather than applaud the production   early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown   afterschool special      even worse   in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people   the studio got a case of the heebie jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re shoot scenes and cut footage to   tone things down      needless to say   the filmmaker was frustrated       we were trying to make a cautionary tale     he told newsweek     and we couldn t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from      regardless   the film works   thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes       crazy/beautiful   is quality fare   good enough that i half expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for   failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes      set in pacific palisades   calif     the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens    every morning and evening   carlos nunez   jay hernandez   takes a two hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school    an honor student and star athlete   carlos is responsible   modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy    all is well until he meets nicole oakley   kirsten dunst     the daughter of a rich congressman   bruce davison      nicole is a drunk apparently hell bent on self destruction    carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her   but he is only human and she has the greatest smile    plus   as her father notes   she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral    as with   save the last dance       crazy/beautiful     god   how i hate lower case titles   takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh    while noting the racial and social differences between the kids   the screenplay dances around most of the clich   s   there are still several mtv moments   though      the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there    cute as a button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole s behavior    she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down   i hoped the boy would listen    as carlos   hernandez is a revelation    hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team   the young man can really act   we will see a lot of this guy in the future    aside from its title   the biggest problem with   crazy/beautiful   is its ending   which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy    after carefully presenting credible characters and situations   the conclusion feels rushed and lazy    still   this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots       afterschool special   my ass     crazy/beautiful   is the real deal    ,1
 everyone knows someone like giles de ath   stuffy   arrogant   set in his ways   and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with   progress      giles is a writer   but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis    his house looks like an immaculate museum   with no television   microwave   word processor   or other technological gadgets   only the electric lights betray that he s living in the twentieth century   not the nineteenth    this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype   but john hurt   in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and 1sibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career   turns   erstwhile fogy   giles into a three dimensional human being    despite his tunnel vision   it s im1sible not to like the man   especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune   love    and   as giles discovers during the course of this amusing   warm hearted motion picture   it s 1sible to find the object of one s affection in the most unusual places    giles   who is a widower and a recluse   does not frequent the cinema   but when he learns that an e   m   forster film is playing at the local theater   he screws up his courage and decides to go    what he doesn t realize is that the movie house is showing two films   the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii    a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress    just as giles is about to leave   however   he notices ronnie bostock   jason priestley     and   suddenly   it s love at first sight    giles is enraptured   and the moment hotpants college ii is over   he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia   including teen magazines and video tapes       in order to watch those tapes   giles must buy a vcr   but he initially doesn t realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr      eventually   not satisfied with being the world s foremost authority on bostock   giles boards a plane and travels to long island   where his idol s home is located    bostock is away when giles arrives   but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie s supermodel girlfriend   audrey   fiona loewi      eventually   the actor arrives home and   impressed with giles  demeanor and intelligence   he begins to rely on the older man s advice    but   while giles  affection runs deep   ronnie s feelings are less constant    love and death on long island is a comedy   and a very funny one at that    in fact   for its first half   the film is nearly perfect    it suffers a fall off once giles reaches new york   and the ending   with its none too subtle homosexual overtones   is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it    in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom   writer/director richard kwietniowski   adapting from the novel by gilbert adair   is 1-1-1% on  target    in the process   he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles   but says a few things about the transforming power of love   even if it is unrequited    from start to finish   this is clearly hurt s movie   he s in almost every frame    it s a role that the veteran actor must have relished   because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure   and does so by means of dialogue delivery   body language   and ever changing facial expressions    jason priestley   cashing in on his beverly hills 9-121-1 image   is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie    he is charismatic   and it s not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie    meanwhile   solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always reliable maury chaykin    love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one   a social commentary   it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment     a buddy picture/love story   ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days     and a   fish out of water   tale   victorian relic giles forced into the modern world      yet   despite the many laughs love and death offers   it never takes cheap shots    it has a vibrant   beating heart   and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile    ,1

 meet joe black   reviewed on nov   27/98    starring brad pitt   anthony hopkins   claire forlani  in   meet joe black     brad pitt plays death    that s all that really needs to be said   but nevertheless   i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description    death decides to take a holiday   what with all the rigors of soul collecting and all   and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it s like to be human    death assumes the body of brad pitt   and from there   much trouble ensues    for one thing   death as pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter   played by claire forlani    obviously this enrages hopkins   because really   what can death offer    besides eternal damnation   of course    there is also a sub plot about forlani s ex boyfriend   she dumps him for pitt   trying to take over hopkins company       meet joe black   runs just under three hours    i ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics       meet joe black   is neither historical nor is it an epic   though i get the feeling martin brest   the director   desperately wants it to be    every single scene in the movie goes on about 3 4 minutes too long    and the ending takes about 2-1 minutes longer than it really should    a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent   instead of just good   which is what it is    pitt   an actor i normally loathe   is actually quite engaging as death    i believed his performance   and i could see why forlani s character would fall in love with him    i have to agree with roger ebert   though   who found it hard to believe that an entity that s been around for all time wouldn t know what peanut butter was    that has nothing to do with pitt s performance   of course   but it is a little distracting    hopkins gives his usual excellent performance    he s able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left   without making him an obnoxious whiner    and in her first major studio role   claire forlani is surprisingly good    she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her    so     meet joe black   is a good movie hampered by it s ridiculous running time    had the film been cut by an hour or so   i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review    ,1
 call it touched by a demon    gregory hoblit s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual   horrific twist    if marketed properly   this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim   dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven    in fact   there s even a little twin peaks to be found here   albeit with the lion s share of the weirdness distilled out       remember bob      the biggest failing of fallen is that   although it s consistently interesting   it s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope    a serial killer   elias koteas   has been on the loose in philadephia   but detective john hobbes   denzel washington     the noblest man on the police force   has brought him to justice    now   during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber   the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes     what goes around really goes around      shortly thereafter   he begins to sing   time is on my side   as he s taken on his last walk    minutes later   the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead    but for hobbes   the nightmare is just beginning   because reese wasn t a normal psychopath   he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel    and   with reese s death   azazel is free to hop from body to body   murdering and wreaking havoc at will    only hobbes and a pretty   female theology teacher   embeth davidtz   have an inkling of what they re up against    the rest of the cops   including hobbes  partner   jonesy   john goodman     lou   james gandolfini     a newcomer to the department   and lieutenant stanton   donald sutherland     don t have a clue   and   as a result   they are in mortal danger    as depicted by hoblit   primal fear   and cinematographer newton thomas sigel   philadelphia is a dark   dreary place   a gothic city rather than a modern one    no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown    the most famous landmark to appear isn t the liberty bell or independence hall   it s geno s steaks    shadows and night scenes abound    the days are cloudy and unpromising    this is the kind of setting where it s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men    fallen s plot is brimming with potential   not all of which is realized    somehow   i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise    but the level of terror   like that of gore   is kept in check    nevertheless   there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks    the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual    of the several dozen actors to play azazel   the best is by far elias koteas   exotica   crash     who   despite only being on screen for about ten minutes   gives a fantastically charged performance    john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself   although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick    sadly   however   these two are the only ones who excel    everyone else   including denzel washington   is boring    washington s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film    it s not that he s bad per se   but he s not very interesting    there s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character   and that keeps us distanced   however slightly   from hobbes    as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop   and as his life or death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate   i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was    washington s subdued approach is part of the reason for this   i never felt a sense of urgency    however   at least washington was believable   which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz   schindler s list   and donald sutherland    to be fair   the flaws in their characters aren t all acting related   neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written    that said   however   there s nothing inspired about either davidtz s or sutherland s work    both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts   as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi dimensional individual    narratively   fallen has a few glaring weaknesses    although the plot proceeds with a convoluted   game like structure   it uses a denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matters    at times   this is actually helpful   and it has a use beyond the obvious   but there are occasions when ponderous lines like   i like the night   sometimes you come face to face with yourself   become a little hard to swallow    in addition   fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland   generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel    however   despite the -1atives   i m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending   which i loved    the final scenes are startling   audacious   and unexpected    it s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did    at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes   fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself    this is not a great motion picture   but   considering how bad most january releases are   it s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours    and   whatever you do   don t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll    ,1
 james l   brooks   one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news   returns to the big screen with this entertaining   if slightly flawed comedy    nicholson plays melvin udall   probably the most horrible person ever on the screen    he s racist   homophobic   and never has a good word to say to anyone    so   nobody talks to him   except waitress carol conelly   t   v  sitcom star hunt   who was last seen in twister   1996      naturally   udall   conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop   kinnear   who nicholson hates   all hit it off in the end    like good will hunting   1997   and titanic   1997     even though the outcome is completely obvious   as good as it gets is an enjoyable   funny and warm comedy    nicholson is hilarious as melvin   churning out insults with superb relish    only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers    hunt is also good as waitress carol   and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson    there s also   thankfully   a bit of chemistry between them    kinnear   as the gay neighbor   seems to have a slightly underwritten role   he s more of a plot convience than a character    although his performance is good   his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together    in fact   the scene stealer is simon s dog   who is funnier than nicholson    but then again   pets are always cute on screen    providing solid support is cuba gooding   jnr   jerry maguire   1996   and yeardly smith   who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons   although gooding isn t as good as is character in maguire   he is still fun    he overacts a little   but not so much as to be annoying    smith is also good   although she has a fairly small role    even director lawrence kasdan   body heat   1981   makes an appearance as a doctor    but this is primarily nicholsons film   and every scene he s in   he s steals it    he s character is so hateful   though   it s amazing that anyone talks to him at all   especially carol    and this is the films main problem    it s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin    she doesn t fall in love with him naturally   the film forces her to fall in love with him    also   melvins character seems to go too nice   too quickly    i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice   loving person    it would take a helluva long time   much longer than this film would like to make out    brooks direction is good   though   if a bit average   but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience    he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones   he tends to pile on to much schmaltz   but generally he s good    there s also a nice soundtrack by veteran com1er hans zimmer    but   generally   as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do   which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie    the movie is a bit overlong   but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly    overall   as good as it gets is a fun movie   even though it may be unbelivable   and certainly worth seeing   if just for jack nicholsons performance      not quite as good as it gets   pardon the bad joke     but still good fun    ,1
 after a stylistic detour with mrs    parker and the vicious circle   which   despite its uncomfortable tone   was close to being a conventional movie     director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow   a romantic black comedy about love   betrayal   and self absorption    while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture   rudolph s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing   if not always pleasant   movie    it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director   meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it    until mrs    parker   i had not been overly impressed by his movies    i found equinox   his last pre  mrs    parker effort   to be irritating and frustrating    i was somewhat surprised   therefore   to discover that i liked afterglow    there are several reasons for this   but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident   mannered aspects of his approach    the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems   the story is absorbing   and the acting is top notch    in short   rudolph has created a world that it s worth spending two hours in    afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples    jeffrey byron   jonny lee miller   is a cold   seemingly heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife   marianne   lara flynn boyle      for her part   marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level    all she s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she s ovulating    after he refuses to make love   she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor    the other couple   lucky   nick nolte   and phyllis mann   julie christie     are an older pair   but they re no more content than jeffrey and marianne    a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart    they remain married as a matter of convenience   but   since phyllis won t allow lucky to touch her   they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs    the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable    the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey    the two of them are immediately attracted to one another   and it doesn t take long before they re lounging together   naked   in her pool    meanwhile   jeffrey   who is captivated by older women   runs into phyllis in a hotel bar   is smitten   and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains    the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love    sex means something different to everyone   to jeffrey   it s an unpleasant chore   a loss of control   to marianne   it s a means to a maternal end   to lucky   it s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles   and to phyllis   it s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness    ultimately   none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves    the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script   but in the performances    jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish   callous   suit and tie businessman    those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity    lara flynn boyle   who wasn t impressive in rudolph s equinox   is greatly improved   making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability    nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky   and he manages to deliver some of rudolph s most pregnant lines with practiced ease    the clear standout   however   is julie christie   who is nothing short of delicious as the world weary phyllis    her often wry   occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film s humor   and there s hardly ever a moment when she doesn t steal the spotlight from her co stars    i don t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph  detractors   but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director s earlier productions    enough of his trademark style remains   however   to reassure his supporters    afterglow is basically a four pronged character study    the plot is not especially compelling   but the character interaction is   and that s the real reason to see this motion picture    rudolph has painted an able picture of the non romantic side of love    the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction    ,1
    the fugitive   is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made    it takes realistic   believable characters and tells an exciting story that s totally believable throughout    this isn t an over the top action flick for the sake of action   this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly    harrison ford stars as dr   richard kimble   a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife    the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder   but is not told in a straightforward manner    we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble s perspective    hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble s wife   helen   sela ward   was murdered    we don t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story    in fact   we might even have a little doubt about kimble s innocence ourselves    the film doesn t spend much time on the details of kimble s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story    one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck    but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated   it is actually suspenseful to watch    this movie is so incredible because it s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable    tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard   a u   s   marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives    from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur    kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other    most of the film deals with richard s complex investigation as he tries to find the one armed man who killed his wife    ford does not have a lot of lines here   so it is stuart and twohy s script and davis s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is    just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits   disguising himself   and doing his own detective work is very interesting    we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed   so as he learns more so do we    meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down    at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues   but richard is just too smart for them    he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery    one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor    there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo   pantoliano   and biggs   roebuck      they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer   yet they constantly start up small talk with each other   making funny wisecracks and one liners   but not in any kind of distracting manner    the final act concludes with another terrific chase    richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him   and although we get a typical fight scene   the case is far from solved    the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along   and we don t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together    maybe the finally scene is a bit much   but it still has a believable atmosphere to it    we re so relieved when justice is served    it s not the plot is that makes   the fugitive   great   it s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story    watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous    if only hollywood could produce more movies like this       1-1/31/96     1/29/97     6/13/97   [see also     nick of time   ]  ,1
 i think that any competent member of the human race who s ever seen a movie  any movie  could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer    even though i try very hard to not predict films as i m watching them   especially not romantic comedies     the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds   and sometimes minutes   before i actually saw it happen on screen    but i don t care    not even a little    my reasons for this are simple   1   adam sandler is great    2   drew barrymore is great    3   the movie is so funny    there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard    i haven t laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers    sandler plays robby hart   a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music    in the opening scenes   he seems like a happy go lucky wedding singer   at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual   steve buscemi   who decides that his brother s wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life   up to that point   was utter pointlessness    a week later   at his own wedding   he is left standing at the altar by his ex fianc   e   linda   angela featherstone      with his life in complete disarray   he meets julia   barrymore     a waitress    she is engaged to glenn   matthew glave     and is to marry him in about three months    julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans    soon   and predictably   it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk   and that robby and julia really love each other    oh sure   it s trite    and if anyone making this film expected us to   like   feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer   then they truly underestimated their audience    what makes the story bearable   aside from the terrific costumes and 8-1s music   are the performances    barrymore is simply adorable here   i ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et      not only is she pleasant to look at   but her acting job here really is a good one  and it doesn t hurt that the character is likable and adequately well written    and the jerk   played in full force by graves   is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i ve ever seen    naturally   the true star here is sandler    i think the guy is flat out hilarious    he can say something that just isn t funny   and his delivery makes me laugh    his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore   but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can   indeed   hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy    whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler   the wedding singer gives him a character that   for the first time   he actually has to fit into    as far as i m concerned he succeeded   and this film is testimony that he does   in fact   have some range in his talents    and the movie is just so funny    perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc   e abandoned him    this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air    and while the film   like all romantic comedies   takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up   there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half    my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren t very important    the film is predicable   but who cares    the characters are extremely likable   the movie is ridiculously funny   and the experience is simply enjoyable    in addition to this   i can t imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film    in that order   i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review    i just want everyone to know that i laughed    a lot    ,1
 based on the boris karloff s classic by the same name   the mummy starts off with the high priest of osiris   imhotep   who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way 1sible    bandaged up   having his tongue removed   and being covered in flesh eating scarab beetles   then entombed       all while still alive    recap a few thousand years later   where a soldier named rick   played by brandan fraser   aids a young historian named evelyn   played by rachel wiesz   and her brother   jonathan   played by john hannah   in finding the book of amon ra   in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy    problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress   using evelyn as a sacrifice        walking in with relatively low expectations   i thought this movie was actually pretty good    the visuals and cgi are astounding   and obviously not cheaply done at all    they pack a ton of detail into the images   especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi    the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes   such as unnerving moments involving flesh eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him   after all   those who took his artifacts are cursed      unfortunately   the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time   becoming a tug of war for control between genres    on one hand   it is a fast paced action film    on the other   it s a frightening horror film    and on the side   it s a hilarious comedy    ideally   for it to be successful   the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect   with one character serving as the comic relief   that would be johnson      the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief   with rick occasionally delivering his witty one liner    if they were trying to make a horror action comedy   it would have helped if it were established early on in the film   but unfortunately   with the backstory of imhotep s entombment   that would be im1sible    and then there s the slapstick fight scene between a sword wielding rick and an army of mummies    while really well done   it had the feel of slapstick comedy    replace the sword with a chainsaw and you d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness    while entertaining and funny   it feels really out of place    but at least it s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of    on the whole   the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end   entertaining the audience    but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners       turn  the sound down !  while a lot of theatres have good sound systems   my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre   the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you re not careful      when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarze-1ger film     end of days     it was so loud i couldn t make anything out    ,1
 on re watching italian writer/director dario argento s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae   i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with    in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles   but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his   giallo   murder mysteries    while it s certainly not perfect   repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller    the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal   anthony franciosa   where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book   tenebrae      with the police on his back for leads   he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems    the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa    he brings grace   charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real life horror around him    the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension    argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral   ambivalent   shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business    tenebrae is perhaps the most multi layered of argento s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here    it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play    in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso   the full length italian language version   and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes    needless to say for argento fans   there is no denying the director s brilliance as a stylist    many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork    they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light   rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria    instead   tenebrae s set design and lighting paints a sleek   clinical   chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world    and the soundtrack s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment    so tenebrae has much to recommend it   no question    still   constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative    some critics argue that logic doesn t matter in argento films   but damnit   it matters in all films to the point where viewers don t deserve to feel cheated    by the way   if you don t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs    about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which   properly handled   could have proved ingenious    we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who   we later discover   is none other than the author peter neal    he is insane   apparently    the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife    he is finally revealed to us as this   second killer   in the film s bloody climax    but argento muffs the twist   both technically and narratively    you see   we are sup1ed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer s house    but thanks to poor editing   its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway    bad cutting puts the timing way out    in other words   he s almost in two places at once    during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring    by the film s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant    the injury    he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !  thus   the revelation of the   hero   as a killer   and anti hero   in the final scenes may still prove shocking   but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled    helpfully   in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along    but there too is a problem   as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least    the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa s mind   his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage    tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies    for instance   a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike    we would assume the rider is the same boy   but it turns out to be some male character we aren t even introduced too !  that s careless filmmaking   pure and simple    why   you may ask   do i go on about the story s flaws    because when it comes to visuals and set pieces   argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world    take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae    an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where   almost unbelievably   it jumps a high fence and chases her across town    finally   as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine   she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer s lair    it s an absolutely masterful sequence   tense and exciting   and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone    and that s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating    too often   it seems   argento s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts    mind you   if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look    and if you re a fan of argento s unique style of giallo thriller then it s essential    see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli    it s a stylish   great looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative    a shame   because it doesn t have to be that way    take argento s more recent stendhal syndrome   1992     where with the aid of co writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache    proof that he can do it   if he tries        ,1
 as any sociologist will attest   your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult    parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives    but if your upbringing is marred with violence   hate and dysfunctionality   then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome    `affliction  explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood    the man in question is wade whitehouse   nick nolte      here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface    he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me    but as you scratch beneath the surface   something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head    we see that he is a mean tempered person    he has a hard time taking control of his emotions   which usually gets the better of him    he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person   but something is sparking a tendency towards violence    he also has tremendous problems with relationships    he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter    but his bearish persona and stature alienates her    he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him    his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl   sissy spacek   at risk    she tries to remain true to him and supportive   but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person   relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point    finally   he is spiteful and vindictive    as a rejected father   he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless    as the town s only police officer   he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died    we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain    he is a prisoner and a slave to it    he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension    what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him    we learn that the answer is his father   james coburn      this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet    he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist    we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks    to heighten the father s churlishness   the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person    very effective    today   wade s dad is quite elderly   but still manages to instill fear into a grown man    the influence that the father 1sesses is inescapable   and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade    the result is every son s nightmare   becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be    this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama   and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity    he s a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father    coburn displays heft as the bitter dad    but   it s most certainly not saturday night friendly fare    there s nothing light or fluffy about this film    that may turn many moviegoers away    but it s certainly worth noting that this is a well acted drama showcasing nolte s and coburn s raw acting talents    ,1
 is evil dead ii a bad movie    it s full of terrible acting   pointless violence   and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release    explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots   including the original evil dead   is extremely difficult    `well what s it about      `five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly   hairy   wart covered monsters      `come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week    why should i see it again      `no evil dead ii is different   it s funny      `it s funny to see people die    are you sick or something      maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie    his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle   as disturbing as it is hilarious    an example of raimi s odd approach   a monster   formerly protagonist ash s girlfriend of all people   is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound    sure it s over the top   but it is so over the top that it is laugh out loud funny   just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood   staining his face and knocking him back a few feet    the whole movie is like this   watch ash get beat up   watch ash defeat the monster   watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster    the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets   the more amusing it becomes    no matter how sick it may sound   it is funny to watch bruce ampbell s ash get his butt kicked every five minutes    and raimi takes advantage   he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend   by the body of an old lady   even by his own right hand    like the less superior idle hands   we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part    but it doesn t end   ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family    all of these events   thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster  like camera movements   at first become shocking   then inexplicably funny    raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses   he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers  duck soup   then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off    with a running time of less than an hour and a half   raimi gets away with the im1sible   making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares    ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series   raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn t wait to make it s sequel    ,1
 it s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year   but that is what disney and pixar animation   s latest film represents    while a bugs life isn t nearly as deep as it s predecessor   dreamwork s antz   it is just as funny    a bug s life centers   appropriately   around the life of an ant   named flik    flik   cutely voiced by newsradio s david foley   hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task    when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost   the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way    the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them    the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper   who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey    when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food    when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission   they never dream he will be successful   they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food    flik s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return    instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs   who he mistakenly assumes are warriors    when he returns with the `warriors    the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes    a bug s life has animation that is simply stunning    the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative    together with the great voice acting   this film is the perfect holiday family film    its main weakness is that it couldn t beat antz to the theaters   making it seem like stale material    ,1
 not since oliver stone s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary   and not since david cronenberg has a so called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility    while fincher s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value   his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples     fight club marks the distillation of his pitch black comedic sensibility   see 1997 s the game   into something like a definitive statement    jack   norton   acting as both narrator and protagonist   is your typical cubicle clone   whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia    on the offhand advice of a doctor   he sits in on group therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer    here he meets bob   marvin lee aday   aka meat loaf     a cancer emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia    strangely   the release he finds while sobbing on bob s breasts allows him to sleep at night   at least until a fellow group therapy   tourist   named marla singer   carter   comes along to ruin things for him   forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity    later   he meets tyler durden   pitt     a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life    one night   after his ikea  furnished condo explodes   don t ask   you ll just have to see the movie   awright       he is goaded by tyler into a fight   and damned if it doesn t feel good    it is pure   raw existence   a brief moment of clarity and pur1e that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison    he moves into tyler s squalid abandoned mansion   and they form the titular organization   an underground therapy group where men bond with bare knuckle savagery and very few rules   the first two of which are   don t talk about fight club      armed with charisma and an attractive anti corporate philosophy   tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white collar slaves and dead end mcemployees    resentment creeps into jack s heart   made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla    funded by a frivolous lawsuit   tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem    their initially juvenile pranks   like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads   quickly evolve into something more like sedition   and jack fears that things have gone sour    it is after this point   when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original   that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist    it is so contrived   and so conventional compared to what precedes it   that everything which follows   including the ending   becomes far less interesting    it s a major   though not fatal   flaw   and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher   it feels like a cop out    fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people    in the early going   it has a downright dangerous feel   it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul   and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it    i ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don t spring up here and there   and i ll be even more amazed if fincher isn t vilified for it by the same humorless witch hunters that are currently after oliver stone    they needn t bother   because fight club is less a message movie than fincher s elaborate attempt at a joke    tyler durden   for all his dionysian allure   is really nothing more than the logical   and far less hypocritical   extrapolation of all those self help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me first gospel of self actualization    in this context   the joke works   but like the latest columbine joke   some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh   and others won t    hopefully   though   their silly moral outrage won t spoil the joke for the rest of us    ,1
 plot   a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention    the boys eventually get together to split the money   but as plans change   double crosses occur   dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road    who s on the up and up   who s the real bad guy and who s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie    critique   the funnest movie that i ve seen so far this year !  it s got style   it s got tough guys talkin  shite and it s got plenty of bullets to go around    a definite hunk a hunk a burnin  adventure !  a guy s guy movie through and through   and one that ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff    it s not very original   it goes on for a little too long   but costner and russell make it happen   as two shite kickin  elvis lovers   who don t stop till they   more or less   drop    this movie s got some pretty intensive shoot out scenes   one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i ve ever witnessed   featuring several elvises with guns a blazin  and the king s music playing in the background   and a decent helping of double crosses   sharp dialogue and funny moments    in fact   even though the cast is filled with many name actors   b actors as they might be for the most part     most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim    but the true glue that holds this film together   other than the spirit of elvis himself   is costner and russell   who play their badass characters to the t   sure   russell s been down this road before   but costner surprised me with his nastiness    i guess he s pissed at all the box office bombs that he s been in of late   but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here    in the end   the bottom line with this movie is having fun   kickin  ass and making sure there s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards    and smoke  em if you got  em   folks !  there is also this one really great show down scene between costner and a cop   that ll have you crackin  up and lovin  it all at the same time    the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next    it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background   with plenty   and i mean plenty   of camera tricks   cuts and edits   but for this kind of flick   it actually works    the film is not perfect though   it starts off with a pretty big bang   but then pulls a way of the gun on us   and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle   while characters intermingle and disperse    i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots   and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well    and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega hot in the movie    no       okay    well i just did !  i coulda done without her whole   romance   angle   but to be honest   it doesn t take up much of the film   which is generally covered in blood   explosions   guts and elvis nods    try to see how many   inside   connections to the king you can guess    of course   it s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind    i also like these types of   guy   movies a lot   and even though the film doesn t bring much originality to the table   it does offer a pretty coherent story   some nice twists and turns   humor and a big ol  helping of whoop ass coming straight from costner and russell s respective boots    probably not a film for everyone   but definitely for those who enjoy the guns   the charismatic bad guys and a fun   if entirely dis1able   adventure    now see how many elvis songs i ve used to pun my way through this phony review below    the elvis songs also recommend this movie !  so whether you re lonesome tonight or any other night   remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets   leave your little sister at home   bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse   cause this movie ain t one to return to the sender    i really beg of you   whether you re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel   to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender    and no suspicious minds either   folks   cause i got stung by this movie   i mean it really shook me up   and unless you re the devil in disguise himself   i think you won t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either    so don t be cruel   don t turn away   don t curl up with your latest flame tonite   whether she be a hard headed woman or not   and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film    it s now or never   folks    trust me   i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i d seen so far this year is far behind me    joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building    thank you       thank  you very much ! !  where s joblo coming from    get carter   7/1-1     heat   8/1-1     honeymoon in vegas   9/1-1     payback   8/1-1     reindeer games   5/1-1    reservoir dogs   9/1-1     way of the gun   6/1-1    ,1
 >from the commercials   this looks like a mild mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight    instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end    the concept is deceptively pedestrian    an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way    the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea    the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents    following one dead end lead after another   each funnier than the previous   they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents   alan alda and lily tomlin    it s difficult to condense the mile a minute plot    seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one    without giving too much away   one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol   tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion    and it s all done in a fairly clean   almost   well   maybe not exactly   family fare manner    a grand cast   tomlin   alda   moore   ben stiller   patricia arquette   tea leoni   george segal   interacts in a seamless parade of laughs    drawing from a more hyper woody allen style   the film succeeds beyond expectations    ,1
 i m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review    i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson s political satire   wag the dog     but in retrospect   this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it    quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through   and it didn t do that    they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all too true attack on the way the american political media works   and it didn t quite do that either    a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick s   dr    strangelove   in the tradition of political black comedy   and it most definitely didn t do that    that said     wag the dog   is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them    the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean   robert deniro   to distract the american public from the accusations that the president   who is up for re election in two weeks   sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office    the accusations   the script suggests   are probably untrue   but as brean so pointedly puts it   that isn t particularly relevant   the scandal is likely to derail the president s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood    brean   along with his assistant   anne heche     decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss   dustin hoffman   to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special effects trickery to make it appear that the u   s   is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor    as i said     wag the dog   is not quite as laugh out loud hilarious as i had expected   but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here   such as when   in an echo of a familiar movie clich     the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting   inspirational music   then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform   we have the right to fight for democracy      another scene shows us how   with modern editing equipment   an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village    the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt    william   old shoe   schumann   woody harrelson     an ex military officer who turns out to be a first class psycho    of course   not everything goes as planned   the cia   for example   realizes what s going on and strikes a deal with the president s electoral opponent to report to the media that the   fighting   has ended   forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the sup1ed albanian crisis    still   even with the cia s involvement   the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable    regardless of the official word from the president or the cia   wouldn t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is   in fact   no fighting going on in albania    the film never addresses this question   nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical   such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt    schumann   we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it    there was also an instance   towards the end of the film   in which one of motss s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away    with these plot holes     wag the dog   doesn t quite work as a satire of american politics   but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place    brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical   rather   they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off    the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end   as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret    motss and his hollywood buddies   meanwhile   seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project    in fact   one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war   in his mind   it is the greatest work of art he has ever created    i think it s fair to say that   wag the dog   underachieves a little bit   more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four star film and a classic satire    still   the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one    wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks   what if the war wasn t even real    with this premise and the talented cast   the film still delivers more consistently than most   whatever its flaws    ,1
 the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible    people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized   methodical hatred    five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days   the first documentary from steven spielberg s survivors of the shoah visual history foundation    the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry    as the introduction explains   even as germany started to lose the war   the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe    in 1944   hungary had the last big population of jews within germany s reach   and they became the last target of hitler s   final solution      each of the five tells his or her story    their stories are intercut chronologically   starting from normal life in pre war hungary    they recall the nazi invasion of hungary   being sent to   work   camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps    they recall their horrible   precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald   the deaths of their family and friends   their loss of hope    each recalls his or her unfathomable   eventual liberation    and finally   the last days shows their cathartic   pained   modern day return to their old homes and the camps    needless to say   their stories are horrifying   amazing   and emotionally draining    by themselves   the stories would be forceful testaments   but by cutting them in parallel   their impact is multiplied by five    the last days is a talking heads style documentary    it s mostly pictures of people telling their stories   intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage    in this kind of movie it s almost im1sible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on screen   but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific   or at least relevant   images to go with his subjects  narration    the liner notes   one of the many nice features of this dvd   indicate that there is some never before seen historical footage in the last days    it s not clear which scene it is    it could be one of two that i hadn t seen before   both powerful    one is rare color footage   shot by an american   of piles of victims in cattle cars    there is something jarring   something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color   when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white    another segment shows walking skeletons   survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore    there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say    but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war   moll told a specific part of the story in a new way   in greater detail    and i m glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject    the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful    x mozilla status   -1-1-19f words for a holocaust documentary   but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring   when skies are blue and trees are green    also   the movie was shot on 35mm film   and not video !      so the richness and detail are impeccable    the dvd s features are plentiful and well chosen    there is a theatrical trailer for the movie   which is a great introduction to the subject matter    there are about fifty still photos   both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors    also   the disc has two complete versions of the movie   widescreen and full screen     both on the same side    one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors   plus one for the crew      you d think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary   but they re not bloopers    instead   they are solid   moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length    one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film    renee firestone   one of the five   spoke on camera with dr   hans m   nch   a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz    firestone was aggressive   questioning the doctor about what his children thought    the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable    another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz    he ends his prayer by saying         forgive me for surviving      it s ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film    it s ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable   television   and movies    it s ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers    but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well    it s only fitting that the dvd   with its wealth of interesting and relevant features   would also be ambitious and successful    ,1
 it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child   whether that may be in life or in death    after having said that   i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well    one gets that choking sensation in the throat   because of grief   when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake   or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement    there is no ocean   no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another   ordinary people     in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing   not that this literally happened in the movie      so what are the lessons learnt   1    don t take your children to class reunions    2   don t leave them alone in the lobby   not even for a second    michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly strung wife and mother   a trend that started with   a thousand acres  and   one fine day     my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie   so much so that when she has a nervous break down   the veins on her temples bulge impressively    whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance   playing a lesbian cop   with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop    lastly   who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie   my grandmother comes to mind    ,1
 i know that   funnest   isn t a word       fun   is a noun   and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective    but that s the word that came to me right after viewing   chicken run      no wonder   this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions   like   that was the funnest movie i ve ever seen !    so to hell with webster s      chicken run   is one of the funnest movies i ve seen in a while    i can t remember the last time i ve seen anything funner    the chickens at tweedy s farm are up to something    living in a concentration camp like atmosphere   they are led by one plucky hen called ginger   voice of julia sawalha   who continually comes up with plans for escape    and always gets caught   subsequently spending day after day in the coal box    one night   a brash american rooster flies in over the fence   calling himself rocky   mel gibson     famous flying rooster and circus performer    rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly   and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs   tweedy   miranda richardson   decides to abandon the farm s egg selling plan for a pie selling plan    she orders a huge pie making machine   cackling     chickens go in   pies come out      what sort of pies    chicken pies   of course    co director nick park and his studio   aardman animation   produced three oscar winning short films     creature comforts       the wrong trousers     and   a close shave      the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit   a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures    part of what made the   wallace   films brilliantly entertaining was park s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new       the wrong trousers     for example   pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks   and   a close shave   owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories    but in the hands of park and his team   the stories felt fresh and inspired   and not the least bit contrived    now teaming with co director peter lord   park has created a similar creature in   chicken run      the plot is largely lifted from   the great escape     watch for a quick reference to the ball bouncing scene     with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement    thing is   the film doesn t feel like it s been lifted from somewhere else     chicken run   feels fresh   alive   like nothing else ever done    part of it is the original idea   who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners of war movie starring chickens    park and lord milk the incongruity for all it s worth   the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious   and to them   it is    but they re * chickens *   so it s funny to us    another thing that helps   chicken run     and most of park s films   succeed is the animators  subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing    there are references to   the great escape     obviously   and   stalag 17      the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both   raiders of the lost ark   and   indiana jones and the temple of doom      there s even a nod to   the blues brothers     if you can believe it   and the filmmakers even get in a little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor   taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson s nationality and film history    the   braveheart   reference is a hoot if you catch it    when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one     chicken run   is downright brilliant in its execution    consider this   since july of last year   i ve seen dozens upon dozens of   blair witch project   parodies   on television   on the radio   and online    out of all those   maybe one or two were amusing   the rest tiresome    why    because once you got past the thought that   they re parodying that&#8216   blair witch  movie     most of the parodies had nothing to offer    no insight   no original idea   no greater pur1e    they were only funny if you had seen the movie   otherwise   you got nothing    conversely     chicken run   doesn t lean on its parodies    the film references are never the sole focus of any scene    if you ve never seen   indiana jones     the chase sequence is still fun    even if you have no idea who mel gibson is   rocky remains an interesting character    park   lord   and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it s understood   and as a result     chicken run   is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious   but not quite vague either    enjoyment of this movie doesn t require knowledge of film history   but if you ve got it     chicken run   is that much richer    the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances   and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it s hard not to fall in love with every one of them    ginger is perfect   spunky and opinionated   but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind   and julia sawalha   known as the cute mousy girl on   absolutely fabulous     nails it    she has warm   human chemistry with gibson   whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung ho veneer    the characters  inevitable romance doesn t feel contrived   but sweet    poor mr   tweedy   tony haygarth   suspects the chickens are organizing in some way   but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out   and his overbearing wife certainly isn t any help    jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs   a hen that runs away with most of the best one liners   all while perpetually crocheting a sweater     and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence    they even come up with an inspired riff on something that s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades   the chicken vs   egg dilemma    one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome   but as with most of   chicken run     it comes as a delightful surprise    the film manages to cross all barriers   it should be accessible to both children and adults   brits and yanks   rats and chickens    the animation is first rate    remember that this was all done the old fashioned way   with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit   and you see just how truly remarkable   chicken run   really is    this movie 1sesses that same quality that makes pixar studios  animation great   precise and unwavering attention to detail    as in such top notch family fare as   a bug s life   or   toy story 2       chicken run   has something to offer in nearly every frame    certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes   but a active   attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details    anyway   the movie s just a boatload of fun    funnest damn movie i ve seen all year    ,1
 capsule   a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg    joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs    it lets us see some new dinosaurs   is that an oxymoron     and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure    the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious    i had a good time       low +2    4 to +4    here goes my credibility    this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority    i liked the third jurassic park film    i even liked the second jurassic park film    in a lot of ways jurassic park   the lost world was a creative three way braiding together of michael crichton s novel the lost world   arthur conan doyle s novel the lost world   and the classic silent film version of the doyle    jp2 was an adventure   as doyle said     for the boy who s half man or the man who s half boy      that is what all the jurassic park films are    expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house    the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon s mines had under written characters also    jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs    the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be   and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting    some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds    that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require    i feel i got my money s worth    the story opens with eric   played by trevor morgan   and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica    this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park    they hope   no doubt   to get a look at the island s dinosaurs from a safe height    the height is safe   but driving the boat in the water is not    the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended    flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant   sam neill   in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide    he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs    but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go    doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple   william h   macy and tea leoni   who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs    they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn    he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once    right    guess what happens next    jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2    first it has alan grant and ellie sattler   laura dern   back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm    sattler has a much smaller part in jp3   but is still present to tie this story to the first    curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance    one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other   suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time    they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films    of course   these raptors look a little different also   so perhaps they are a different related species    not only are they more intelligent than in the past films   they are also more sympathetic    in this story they are not just killing machines   they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition    this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized    each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs   of course    in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus   not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus   but larger and presumably more nasty    it has a crocodile s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright    perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs    sometimes they just move too fast to see    occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision    a few times we get unconvincing matte shot   particularly of the laboratory    but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films    the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams s score for the first film    joe johnston   who directs   already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky    a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay    the film they have made is a long way from great cinema   but it still is fun    if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today   the film is for you    i rate it a 7 on the -1 to 1-1 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    ,1
 just look back two years ago at the coen brothers  comedic gem the big lebowski   change the actors   take away the bowling alley   add a record store   and you ve got high fidelity   or maybe the other way around since nick hornby s novel high fidelity came first      either way   it s been done before   a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances   yet it remains consistently funny    why is this    maybe because you know your life is much better than this   you know these guys are more pathetic than you are   and you know its ok to laugh at them because they re fictional    director stephen frears   1sibly not intentionally   has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day    when watching high fidelity   expect to laugh at someone else s pain   realize what you are laughing at   and then laugh again    i laughed at dick   todd louiso     the shy   timorous   steve buscemi character of lebowski   who seems to know what he is talking about but either can t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends    i laughed at the john goodman character barry   jack black     an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons   pudgy   egotistic   and obnoxious at the same time    and i laughed at rob   john cusack     the jeff bridges type   whom the story revolves around    rob is the character easiest to relate to   but he is nothing like you at all    he uncontrollably cheats and lies   then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman    and like his other miserable friends   pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort    he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it    whatever human emotions the clash   aretha franklin   and bruce springsteen records hold   rob and co    grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives    rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in    during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on   rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him    but these aren t any girlfriends   these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob   rob s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life      the plot in three words is   women and music    the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective    it gives high fidelity a quickly paced   informal structure   adjectives which perfectly parallel rob s own lifestyle    it also helps open the viewer s eyes as to how annoying barry is    jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball    just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob   who must work with him every day of the week    what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes    john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast   consisting of big stars and character actors   that really defines rob    now instead of rob just talking to the camera   after he explains something   the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say    the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn t end when it should have ended    instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that    also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie    high fidelity is a cheerful   old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs    i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen   they make everyone look and feel great    ,1
 plot   a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes    he is taken prisoner along with some other humans   and tries his best to escape his simian captors    oh yeah   and did i mention that the apes can talk    kewl !  critique   despite this film not looking like a   tim burton movie   or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself   i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun   summer fare    although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make up jobs and characterizations    i mean   i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real !  i also have to   give it up   to all of the actors inside the costumes   not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make up slobbered all over them for 2 4 hours   but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well    i especially enjoyed bonham carter s performance   who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film   human or ape   and tim roth s bad guy   who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part    plot wise   i liked the beginning of the film   the whole build up once wahlberg got into the village   the escape and most of the fight scenes   but once things got out into the deserted area   and the final battle sequence     i kinda lost a bit of my interest    i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of   human beings as animals   then i was about the end battle sequence   which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film    i also hated the   kid   character who just got on my nerves and didn t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved   i won t ruin it here but c mon guys       you  coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that   no        but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character   his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter species love interests    this dude didn t seem to give a rat s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn t really care about what happened to him either    now i m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script   but the film suffered because of it    visually   the movie was also nice to look at   especially the apes !     but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton    the   surprise ending   that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968   felt a little tacked on here   and despite being interesting   didn t really make all that much sense to me   unless you look at it from a sequel point of view      so overall   i loved the whole   feel   of the planet   the apes that ruled it   the manner in which they treated the humans   screamed   shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain   but didn t appreciate the film s lack of human character development   why was kris kristofferson even in this movie     and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring    but i would still recommend this film as a fun   summer movie with laughs   creepiness and a really cool premise    ps   for anyone who has seen the original   i cannot believe that they didn t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character   in this case   mark wahlberg   goes nuts at the world in which he s suddenly been thrust     this is a mad house !      type of thing      the guy in this film barely seems to be   put off   by the fact that he s surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !  where s joblo coming from    the arrival   8/1-1     battlefield earth   7/1-1     godzilla   4/1-1     instinct   6/1-1     mission to mars   3/1-1     pitch black   7/1-1       1968   planet of the apes   9/1-1     sleepy hollow   8/1-1    ,1
 disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched    to see a disaster film with actual originality   or at least a decent plot twist   would definitely be a welcome surprise    unfortunately   folks   it s not likely    dante s peak is cliched   and at times corny   but also pretty decent    to be honest   i wasn t very interested in seeing this film   and word of mouth   as well as several reviews   didn t make it sound promising    so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn t bad at all    it s pretty run of the mill   but it s not something i would say is merely   ok   to watch    in case you don t know   dante s peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it s shadow   dante s peak   who would ve guessed   eh        pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and   perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof   is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future    due to the lack of more substantial evidence   nobody warns the small town   and when they finally do   it s in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows    brosnan   all around good guy   will   of course   save the day            or at least the mayor of dante s peak   linda hamilton      naturally the two will become infatuated with one another       if you think i just ruined a plot development   you haven t seen very many movies !    there s also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings    and of course   the kids or the dog   at least one or the other   will do something heroic            but hey   i don t want to ruin all the surprises !  if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time   i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself    it s not brain food   but it succeeds at what it s meant to be            an enjoyable   suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !  ,1
 in brief   best bleak comedy film since heathers    full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture    go see it !  so   i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on   hard copy   with pam smart   the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 198-1 s       hard copy    s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for    smart replied that she thought kidman s character came off as a dumb   vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal       smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband      smart s got a point    it wouldn t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version    however   given a choice between the mass media  happening  of the real event and the fictionalized movie   i would definitely opt for the later    real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart   while pretty and alluring   is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman    to die for begins in a town called little hope   new hampshire   the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb    the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being  on tv      of course   one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry   played by matt dillon    but   with a little imagination   some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement   our heroine manages to overcome the nay sayers in her life   at least temporarily    kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne    i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture    her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates    kidman knows a star making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven   1t feminist uber temptress from hell    she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue   which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way    at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister in law       you know     she knowingly exclaims     gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever   if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head      her husband beams at suzanne s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters    this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven   folks    the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix    he plays jimmy   a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne s sexual favors    kidman s character   vapid though she is   is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia   winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland    phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen x slackerhood   as envisioned by tabloid tv   of course      his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain t going anywhere   ever    phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne   someone who actually noticed him    gus van sant   drugstore cowboy   my own private idaho   direction is first rate    he keeps the pacing in this not quite thriller snapping along    van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions    van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to  get it  without stopping to explain what is funny about this all american story    the screenplay   by buck henry   is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i ve heard since heathers    henry s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame   yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters    henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini classic    danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric   loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands    either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick or treat parties    all in all   a wonderful production   well worth your seven bucks !  to die for   a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant    written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman   matt dillon   joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard    rated r   for language and mature themes       respect the r   not for under 14 s   rating       stars    go see it    ,1
 i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool    i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage   grousing to myself about its transparently planes   trains and automobiles plot machinations   and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement    this was a mass market romantic comedy   after all   a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and   even in its best days   worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm    then marc lawrence did something wonderful   something which made the entire film click into place   he showed me a comic love story about grown ups    it certainly didn t look that way from the outset   which introduces groom to be ben holmes   ben affleck   at his bachelor party   surrounded by friends and family whooping over his   last night of freedom      ben loves his fiancee bridget   maura tierney     but the doom and gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this  till death do you part business    then   on an ill fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah   ben meets sarah lewis   sandra bullock     a free spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her    as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn   ben and sarah begin a three day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger   ben seeing in sarah the chances he s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she s never had    forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start   setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue    ben is an ideal role for affleck s easy going charm   and he plays the straight laced straight man without forced exasperation    sandra bullock   for her part   is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half dozen films combined   avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping    the two performances    part of a great top to bottom cast    are effective and connected from the start   yet the script s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely    lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis   forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self justification    the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the op1ite pur1e   leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution    forces of nature isn t about a man developing a fear of commitment   it s about a man learning what commitment means  to him    learning that it s not what he thought it was    lawrence s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending   an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense    earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance   and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine    though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film   and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples   forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom    that is   provided you re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes    for a brisk romantic comedy   forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over directed scenes of the year   teetering hand held shots   why not low or high angles   sweeping pans    occasionally the hyper real approach works   with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance   far more often   hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is   covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can t find what s underneath    a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director   but even hughes  excesses can t spoil this unique concoction    forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant   something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents    ,1
 warning   this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film   fail safe      if you haven t seen the film yet   proceed with caution    nutshell   a relevant   intelligent   suspenseful drama    still powerful today   even after the end of the cold war                           fail safe     usa   1964   drama   111 minutes  screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e   youngstein directed by sidney lumet  review by jamahl epsicokhan                       the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn t have a winning side and a losing side    in a nuclear confrontation   everybody loses   and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world  assuming the world survives    the idea  and perhaps the only real option  is to avoid war at all costs    this is the theme of sidney lumet s   fail safe     a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler       fail safe   takes place during the heart of the cold war   the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis     when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word   communism    the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws    five u   s   bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america    the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner   but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers    suddenly out of contact   and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives   the bomber pilots cannot be recalled   and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike    a great deal of   fail safe    s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u   s   bombers from reaching russia s borders  at any cost    the plot is compelling   and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios    the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails    general bogan   frank overton     taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself   henry fonda     is powerless  the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated   pre programmed system that may not be stoppable   simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no win situation winnable    the events in   fail safe   are fascinating because they re anything but predictable   but the real reason   fail safe   works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot    a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war   communism   the cold war   and the united states  role in all of it    most of this is through the film s use of the character groeteschele   walter matthau     an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who   incidentally   is on the president s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war    many of the film s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices    early in the film   he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of   strategy   in a nuclear assault to   minimize   casualties       what s the difference between 6-1 million and 1-1-1 million dead      a guest asks impatiently       forty million     groeteschele responds wryly    the problem with groeteschele s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war    the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals    groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over    yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off   as general black   dan o herlihy   has often recommended    on the contrary  according to groeteschele   that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u   s     which would clearly put america at a disadvantage    such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race       fail safe   clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war   and   likewise   it becomes a central theme in the film    why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already 1sessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over    is it wise    is it even logical    no   not really    although   fail safe   is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism   there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial   one sided sort of way    again   this is achieved through groeteschele   who is easily the film s most important character in terms of the larger theme significance    in addition to providing the central   pro nuclear war   voice that the film warns against   he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism    the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib    one of groeteschele s   logical   trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it s merely absurd    he labels the average marxist an   unfeeling   calculating machine   that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself    groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u   s   drops the warhead on moscow   the soviets will * instantly * surrender   for to retaliate would invite counter measures that would further destroy russia s home soil  which must be preserved at all costs    groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions   general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge  as any normal person would    the irony here is groeteschele s own mechanical theorizing    he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns    once the film makes it evident that turning the u   s   bombers will be im1sible   the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be    just how will the soviet union s leader react   and what can the president do to convey his best intentions       just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap *      with the help of his translator buck   larry hagman     the president -1otiates at length with the soviet leader   in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity   with lumet s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame   exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader    without getting into too much detail   i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly   yet necessary and as sensible as 1sible under the circumstances       that is   as sensible as a nuclear   incident   can probably be      it does accomplish what it must   it avoids an all out war   something that simply isn t 1sible because of its all too real consequences    dramatically   the ending is quite powerful   and the use of o herlihy s character as the symbolic   matador     providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film s opening     is particularly appropriate       fail safe   is a production of a major hollywood studio   released by columbia pictures     and it has the structure of a high tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film    nevertheless   under lumet s direction and walter bernstein s intelligent adaptation of burdick s and wheeler s novel   the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded    the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming    but it was the conscious   human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that   fail safe   also finds dangerous    in retrospect   the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century    it s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down   rather than continuing groeteschele s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a 1sible meltdown    ,1
 andrew lloyd webber s musicals   preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice   present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time    webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as   oklahoma !     or the slapstickness of shows like   a funny thing happened on the way to the forum      they instead tackle hot issues from our past   and view them differently   and pack them together with redundant   catchy music   as well as thoughtful lyrics    like   jesus christ superstar     which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective   in the cool tune   superstar     a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn t spread his message wider       evita   takes an inventive stance on its topic   this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator   juan per   n   eva   who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention   much like the woman playing her   madonna   although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent   among other things         evita   deals with the rise and fall of eva per   n   a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan   jonathan pryce     then died at the young age of 33   creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di   the two do share a bit in common   although it wasn t like di slept to   the top        webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals   but they always have a point for doing it    here   they wish to ex1e her for what she is   but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks   her lying   and covering up for her fascist husband   but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions   and her death was very sad    it s also a musical   with almost no words not unsung    the film plays like a rock opera   much like their   jesus christ superstar     with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals   even if they do 1sess very intelligent lyrics   which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience   but also a very entertaining one    after all   this is a musical   and webber s musicals never undermine this    they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth   walking on a fine line between the both   and never stumbling on either side    this is why the beginning of   evita   is kind of a let down    okay   it is a let down    i m not saying the opening moments are bad   because they re pretty good    but what comes after is a lifeless   un entertaining   and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer   jimmy nail   into taking eva to buenos aires after a one night stand    in the musical   it s a fun   energetic sequence   culiminating in the show stopper     buenos aires     which is also lifeless    then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer   instead of her leaving him   where she ends up singing the sad tune     another suitcase in another hall     which was meant for a later character   screwed over by eva    the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft   seeming like parker and oliver stone   who adapted it for the screen   are afraid to present her for what she is   even while it s being narrated by a hater of eva s   the omnipotent   antonio banderas     who presents her in a -1ative light    for a while   it looks like alan parker can t pull it off    however   the film pulls itself together in a flash   and after that song is over   and the giddily nihilistic song   goodbye and thank you     where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend   is magnificent   darkly comical   and just gleeful    from this point on   the film is hypnotic   satisfying   and satirical    no more punches are thrown   and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact    we see eva woo and marry juan   get him out of jail   rise to stardom   falter a bit   come back   and then gradually die of cancer   i think it was because of cancer      more importantly   many of the themes from the musical carry on with this   as well as some filling in the gaps reconnassaince work    juan   who is pretty underwritten in the musical   is given some extra scenes   and ex1ed as what he was for eva   an accessory    a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan   and understand his sadness more than we did before    >from the   goodbye and thank you   number on   the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation   and saved a government   even while it left the nation s people downtrodden    but despite this   the nation still loved eva   and when she slipped into death   the world mourned her because she was a star    that s when our narrator   ch     comes out to show that she wasn t the great woman she really was   and ex1e her fame    describing this character is difficult   mainly because he has no real realistic background   he s said to be based on the revolutionary ch   guevera   but the two probably could have never met   like they do in the film     but he serves as a perspective on eva   but even his perspective can t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death    alan parker   no stranger to bizarre musicals   he s done   fame       the committments       bugsy malone     and   pink floyd the wall     the latter which is absolutely brilliant     nails the film   ex1ing everything for what it is    we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should   by the way it is presented    his direction is manipulative for a reason   to show the mourning for what it is    and there is energy throughout   with lots of bright colors   and scenes which are cinematically entertaning   as well as enriching and deep   such as the balcony scene where she sings   don t cry for me   argentina     and her death sequence   which is poignant becuase of how sad it is    madonna s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie   starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly   remaning there for the rest of the film    at the beginning   she looks like she s too busy concentrating on her singing to act   but she eventually gets it right   though never really getting the presence of   say   patti lupone   who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 7-1s      her death   though   is brilliant    her singing could be better though    i know she took lessons to improve her range and all   but it still sounds like she s trying to hard    she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding   like       patti  lupone   i heard her sing on an old   evita   cd   and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her      but it s generally very good   although not up to the brilliance the role really requires    antonio banderas   who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days   i m one of the few people who thinks he rocks     is extremely comanding in his performance   presenting a lovable narrator    his singing is very good   though nothing compared to the original   mandy patinkin    he does have a pretty good singing voice   and a great range    and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome   although very brief at times   in his role as juan   seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade    although it gets off to a rocky start     rocky    s polite for what it really is     it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical    like the other musical released in  96   woody allen s   everyone says i love you       it s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead   but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance    ,1
 there s more to a quilt than fabric and thread  each patchwork design has its own unique story   or stories   to tell    in how to make an american quilt   the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse   proof     we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality    all the sorrows   joys   longings   sufferings   and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and   as their bittersweet memories are given expression   one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future    motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals   how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative    the   quilting bee   consists of seven members   sisters gladys   ann bancroft   and hy   ellen burstyn     sophia   lois smith     a woman known for frightening children   emma   jean simmons     the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man   constance   kate nelligan     who has been having an affair with emma s husband   anna   maya angelou     the leader of the group   and marianna   alfre woodard     anna s daughter    the project they re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy s granddaughter   finn   winona ryder     who has just become engaged    she s spending the summer with hy and gladys   and away from her fiance   to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants   and whether it s better to marry a friend or a lover    one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast    from winona ryder   ann bancroft   ellen burstyn   and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn   claire danes   and kate capshaw   this film is overflowing with realized talent    the performances are good enough   in fact   to cover up many of the script s weaknesses    how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable   if affecting   tale of love across the generations  a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club   with a dash of fried green tomatoes added    there are probably too many characters    so   instead of really getting to know a few of them   we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives    we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy   and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible    there are other episodes as well   the love of anna s life   marianna s soul mate   and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend s husband    the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn s story   whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger    there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt    the stories are all well told   but it s difficult to really connect with the characters  their moments pass so quickly    while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals   our emotional investment is tenuous    there isn t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way   and many of the personalities and relationships feel half  formed   like a quilt with patches missing    to put it bluntly   while i enjoyed watching this film   it didn t   do much   for me    on the whole   how to make an american quilt is a nicely understated drama that has a lot to say about love   passion   and monogamy in relationships    finn s segment is by far the most compelling   because she s the focal point   her actions are shaped by everyone else s experiences    the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees    if there s a disappointment here   it s that the script doesn t have more resonance   but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional    ,1
 mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv show er    her mast famous episode     love s labour lost     dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child    the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing    there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood s big blockbuster movies    so it s only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster    and i have to say   after a shaky beginning   she does not disappoint    peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists   which is obviously nothing new    the first half hour goes into detail   way too much detail   about how the weapons are stolen    despite a few good images   including a train collision and a very impressive explosion   none of this was very coherent    it s long and drawn out   and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better    once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture   it begins to take off    george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world    he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters    nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling    there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two   but that is dispensed with quickly    the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe   trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them   clooney  goes through bouts of sarcasm   frustration   determination   and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self doubt    this is when leder starts to show her true stuff    she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer    then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter    then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city s crowded streets   and a madman with a nuke walking among them    mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense    she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking    nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero    you re not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her    george clooney is a real movie star    many of you may have hated him as batman   but this guy is for real    he has a natural screen presence   and an ingratiating personality    he ll be around for a while    dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker    ,1
 i have to say it    tim burton s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys    ok   that s off my chest    no more monkey puns   i promise    seriously   though   planet of the apes is one rip roarin  summer outing   filled with thrills   action   adventure   wit and bits of funny   dare i say   monkey   business    i know   i know   i promised    and for those film buffs who are fond of the original   burton s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie    mark wahlberg stars as capt   leo davidson   a deep space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future    he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted   captured and sold into slavery    despite being darker than the original   burton s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious    some of the movie s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton   an organ grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed    then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter    the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty     one thing you don t want in your house is a human teen ager     he says    you don t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement    touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton s brand    lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout   the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian s foot to try righting himself are     take your stinking hand off of me   you damned   dirty human      anyone familiar with the first version of the film will   of course   recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue    another of burton s in jokes is to have charlton heston   star of the original   play the chimpanzee father of tim roth s gen   thade    the young chimp goes to visit his dying father    both have one thing in common   a hatred of humans    with his dying breath   the elder spews out his vile     damn them   damn them all to hell     he says before expiring    that is the famous line heston s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet s terrible secret    the performances throughout are top notch    wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung ho hero   but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home    he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion   his only objective being to find a way off this upside down planet    this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable    roth is ferocious   cunning   cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity    he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet    it is a masterful turn    helena bonham carter is ari   the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals    hers is a smart   compassionate characterization    michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken    a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo   the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures    as the battle between apes and humans looms   the cowardly limbo pleads     can t we all just get along     echoing the words of rodney king    much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton s technical crew   especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup    burton s musical collaborator   danny elfman   provides another fine score   though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow    the movie s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original    he comes close   but falls short    otherwise   planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be   an amusement park ride filled with lots of action   stunts and a few laughs    this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre release hype    ,1
 urban legend surprised me    based on the last few films the genre has produced   including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer   disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween   h2-1     i was 1itive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena    thankfully   legend rose above it s soggy premise to become not only a hip   scary and stylish entertainment   but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year    you re all familiar with the plot   a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be   you guessed it   everybody s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks       the  only person you didn t suspect !  however   just because legend doesn t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can t qualify as first class entertainment    it was   believe it or not   one of the funnest times i ve had at the movies all year    the thing is   i m not really sure what made this particular stab   pardon the pun   at the genre seem so fresh and alive    maybe it was the above par performances by the movie s two leads   jared leto and   cybil   actress alicia witt      or   it could have been the on  target direction by jamie blanks    more likely   though   it was because of the inspired premise    i don t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman    urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener   not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film    a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when   gasp !   a gas problem   hee hee   forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill    one problem   though    would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif    i thought not    predictably   the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company    it s odd   though   when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody s on the other line    naturally   the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off    and the when we least expect it       whack ! ! !  a decapitation    it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car    so who is it this time    the obvious candidate is the slightly off kilter professor at the college the girl went to   none other than freddy kruger himself   robert englund     who teaches a class on urban legends    a ha    or could it be the fame hungry local journalist   leto   looking for a meaty story to put on his resume    like all movies of this nature   one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit    and it turns out to be   of course   the one you didn t suspect    i m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is   but i must give credit where credit is due    and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been       fun     * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi   ca  ,1
 capsule   the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi day festivities    mira nair s film is pleasant enough with a little human drama   a few family secrets   some sadness and some happiness    you have seen it all before   but perhaps not from india    the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable       low +2    4 to +4    mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala    her newest film   written by sabrina dhawan   is very similar to previous films like betsy s wedding but it is set in new delhi    a wealthy family is having a wedding    an indian wedding is a multi day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial    even more than in the us   it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get together    the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members  individual story lines    aditi verma is marrying hemant   an indian engineer working in the us    she had previously had a relationship with vikram   her supervisor    latit   her father   played by naseeruddin shah     is juggling many problems   not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey    dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration    even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice   one of the family servants    several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex   family secrets   or both    there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love    some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films    western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna    on the other hand it was not clear   to me at least   if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films    this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english    the latter will   however   help with an international release    sabrina dhawan s screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog    we have seen films with plotting very much like this   but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference    director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life    i rate it a 7 on the -1 to 1-1 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    ,1
 the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man s life   especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances    thematically in cinema   love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters   it is rare   however   for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni s neo classic drama   life is beautiful    through a central cast of father   mother   and son   benigni demonstrates the wonderful   undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times    life * is * beautiful for guido orefice   roberto benigni   directing himself here for the sixth time in his career     an italian jew   master con man   and aspiring waiter extraordinaire    living in 193-1 s italy   he lives a carefree life of good fortune   it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora   nicoletta braschi      although dora is already engaged   guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead   the two have a child named joshua   giorgio cantarini      unfortunately for the happy family   the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps    it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie s theme of family love becomes the strongest    although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm   he relaxes the role to ensure his son s happiness    now   instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora   he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right    benigni s performance is truly a well rounded one   and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year    the supports are all strong as well   but the movie truly excels in its script    life is beautiful is a self proclaimed fable   one which tells its story in grand   two part fashion    in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a   saturday night live   spinoff    a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot    but in the movie s second half the script s circular nature becomes admirably obvious    characters make reprise appearances in fine form   and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot s outcome    in all   fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture   and novice movie watchers may take this opportunity to see their first   artsy   film    life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone   and above all is a fine thematic picture    ,1
 while watching wes anderson s rushmore   it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer   the film s anti hero   was not written with jason schwartzman in mind    the young actor   making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman    schwartzman plays max   a student who is more interested in his extra curricular activities   such as writing edgy plays like   serpico   and being president of the rushmore beekeepers   but sees his grades suffer as a result    on the brink of being thrown out   he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross   olivia williams   and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume   the great bill murray   to build an aquarium   on rushmore s baseball field   in her honour    unfortunately for everyone involved   blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well   which gets in the way of max s plans to woo her    max is one of the best written characters we ve yet seen in the 9-1s   and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age    as everyone else has probably already pointed out   he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman   although i was reminded more of paul from   the wonder years     from a visual standpoint   at least      hopefully   if he avoids typecasting as weird   quirky loner types he should earn himself a good career    bill murray is his equal as blume   displaying a depth we haven t yet seen from him    while this isn t his best performance   that honour goes to groundhog day   he is still terrific here    williams isn t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray   but still does fine work    rushmore seems to go just a little too long but   while it isn t a perfect film   it is a definate must see for anyone who wants to see that rarity   an american coming of age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality    anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should   with any luck   rise to even greater success    ,1
 no   i did not read the novel by thomas hardy     jude the obscure     his final novel   final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again   see   i did do some research on it   about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life    but   after watching the movie   i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is       jude   is a satirical film from start to finish about society s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system   but what s remarkable is how timeless this film is    the film takes place in the late 19th century   or early 2-1th   wasn t really sure     but its story could even be retold today in modern form   although it d be kinda different   a given      it tells the story of jude   christopher eccleston   the psychotic accountant from   shallow grave       a simple   dim witted young man with big dreams    in its bleak   foreboding opening   shot in grainy black and white   he gets a lesson from phillotson   liam cunningham     his teacher   as they stand upon a mountain   looking upon a city in the distance   he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world    after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella   rachel griffiths   because they frolicked in the hay   literally   but did not ultimately share anything in common   he moves away to a town with a giant university   with a chance to learn more   and get ahead in life    taking a welding job   he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars   reciting latin over and over again   and training himself    but when he sends his application for the school in   he is bluntly told to just remain a worker    another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there   sue   kate winslet     his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher    she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends   so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job   for none other than phillotson at the local school     there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business   nudge nudge      several twists turn in the storyline   and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business   an interesting scene   to say the least           and are soon born into a controversial non wedlock   as she eventually gives birth to their baby   and jude inherits his son from arabella   who turns up again after awhile    because they aren t married   and because they re cousins   they run into problems with every place they go to   carrying around two children everywhere   and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time   then moving on    if you didn t think this was harsh enough   wait till you see what happens later on        the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world    he will never gain any true happiness   and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting   and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life    part of it is his fault   he s too optimistic   and too gullible    but society has a way of taking these people   and hurting them until their death    the ending of   jude   is bleak because it has to be   although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse   guess i ll have to read it now         jude   offers a satirical view on society s cruelties   but shows no way of curing this   and thank heavens it doesn t    there s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society   and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem    satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people s minds   and that s what   jude   is    sure   it s one hell of a downer   but it needs to be    the film also 1esses two fantastic performances from its two leads   and some good supporting work along with it    christopher eccleston   slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression   plays jude wonderfully   sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face   and making him kind of child like at other times    kate winslet   in a pre    titanic   performance   is brilliant   nailing every psyche of her character   and creating someone who s troubled but very seductive with her personality    kate may be the best actress in her age group   if you don t believe me   see   titanic     branagh s   hamlet       sense and sensibility     and   heavenly creatures     the latter one being my favorite performance of hers      in the supporting roles   liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher   ex1ing all his bad parts   but ultimately being a pretty good person   and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude s wife   whom he never divorces       jude   moves at a very slow pace   and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists   which would drive some people nuts    but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films   no matter how slow or downright depressing they are   this one is both   will appreciate   jude     though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it    ,1
 quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie    he runs into the last dragon in existence   and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth   but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain    eventually   they decide to call a truce   and they work out a deal    since he is the last dragon   he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it    their scam works at first   until they come to a town without any money    instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon   but of course   draco is a nice droagon   so he won t eat her   there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl    of course   as you can probably tell by the plot   this is a silly movie   but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times   unlike eddie   which was serious all the time    you could probably call this a medieval comedy   because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined    dennis quaid makes a fine hero    pete 1thlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them    dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl    but lets face it   the movie is really about the dragon   and what an amazing creation he is    connery s voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon    so   if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic   you are going to the wrong movie    if you are going because of the dragon   you will not be dissapointed   and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script    ,1
 it has been 2-1 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters    his new film   the thin red line   is a strange   beautiful   enigmatic mess of a movie    the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast    it is filled with above the title stars    the cast   for the most part   gives great performances    john travolta   whose role is nothing more than a cameo   seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve    george clooney   whose role became a cameo in editing   gives a strange performance    one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character s narration    the rest of the cast   especially nick nolte and elias koteas   are unambiguously fantastic    these actors   and they are   with two exceptions   men   were lured by the name of malick    terrence malick is a cinematic legend    he has often been called   the j   d   salinger of cinema      his two previous films   badlands and days of heaven   are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures    after he made them   he disappeared for 2-1 years    this film marks his return    what he s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment    the narration which fills the film   and perplexes many   not only lets us hear the narrators   the characters themselves   pontificate   but also lets us hear such of the moment thoughts as   i m scared      the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted    the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill    a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult   because the story is fractured    many stories are here   from the clash between the lieutenant   elias koteas   and the savage colonel   a voracious nick nolte   to the private   ben chaplin   who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going    the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault    it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box   shook the box   and poured the results onto a table    this basically creates a mess   but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed    i m not declaring that the film has no structure    while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot   malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 9-1 minutes of combat    the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking    the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice    this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way   that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video    ultimately   malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them    the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature    while some have said that the anti war message and pro nature tubthumping was juvenile   it was done with so much complexity and thought   that it cannot ever honestly be called childish    after seeing the thin red line   i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again    ,1
    stuart little   is one of the best family films to come out this year    it s a cute   funny and very good natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords    though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about   i do know that this film does not disappoint    finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be   with a few surprising twists   some very funny moments   and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie    stuart little is a mouse    he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption   he now lives with the littles    a nice little   no pun intended   family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city    they have a little boy george   played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki   and now they have a new son    at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat    george doesn t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first   but once the two play together they instantly bond    stuart however is missing something   and he wants to know who his real parents are    the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back    hesitating the littles know what s best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat   he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart s past ending up to a sentimental and very heart warming ending    one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects    just like in   star wars   episode 1  the phantom menace   stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real    from the detail of their fur   to the detail of the way the walk   the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $9-1 million dollar film and it shows    another movie that this has in common with is   babe   with it s talking animals and people understanding them    it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids    michael j   fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the   homeward bound   movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could    he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable    another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball    when he was timon in 1994 s   the lion king   i would have sworn he was a comedian   and now in   stuart little   he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike    for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well    she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr   little    both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996 s   jerry maguire      even though stuart little is completely cgi   the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other       stuart little   is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter    we get entertainment   laughs   cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie    its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see    even though it has a $9-1 million dollar budget i m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively    for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie   i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know   stuart little   and   toy story 2   are by far the best family films this year    a winner      ,1
 as with his other stateside releases   jackie chan s latest chopsocky vehicle   mr   nice guy   is contrived   blockheaded   and lacking in narrative logic    but also like those other films   it is a highly enjoyable ride    once again   chan s screenwriters   here edward tang and fibe ma   have taken the easy way out and named their star s character simply jackie   with no last name    this jackie is a world class chef who co hosts a popular cooking show on australian television    of course   jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist   and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter s   gabrielle fitzpatrick   ex1e of a drug dealing ring    other plot details   involving a videotape and a biker gang   are irrelevant   in fact   as is the case with most chan films   the plot itself is just about irrelevant    the sole pur1e of mr   nice guy s existence are chan s comic fight scenes   and those here do not disappoint    director samo hung   who has a cameo role     a longtime collaborator of chan s   does not waste any time putting chan in action   diving head on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue    other impressive set pieces follow   most notably a chase in a mall   which directly leads to some frenzied   if cliched   can you say fruit cart       business involving a runaway carriage   and an extended late film sequence at a construction site   in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards   cement mixers   and a deadly buzzsaw    none of the action sequences in mr   nice guy are as spectacular as supercop s thrilling helicopter train finale or rumble in the bronx s daring leap between two buildings   nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor   respectively    but the action delivers   even if the energy peters out before the film s end   the finale   as spectacular as it is   is a letdown for fans of chan s athletic prowess      filmed almost entirely in english   even so   the voices of some english speaking actors are laughably dubbed     mr   nice guy hints at jackie chan s latest transition to hollywood productions   he made ill fated attempts with 198-1 s the big brawl and 1985 s the protector     next in the pipeline is rush hour   a stateside production co starring chris tucker    hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown   and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr   nice guy   for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands   much like they have been before    ,1
 the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it s adequately explained by the commercials    with 11 days to go until the election   the president   who we never see   calls in political dirty tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal    deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a   pageant     a phony war against albania   fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville   with woody harrelson as the reluctant   psychotic hero    and if there wasn t anything more to the movie than this   it would be a second rate heist comedy at best   enlivened by great actors    like sneakers goes to washington       a heist comedy    yup    deniro and hoffman are   stealing   the election   so to speak   and the movie is more about how they do it    and the fun they have doing it    than anything else      wag the dog succeeds because it s based one great truth   the american people are stupid    ok   maybe it s not   love thy neighbor as thyself   or even   two plus two makes four     but a truth nonetheless       any average person who thinks that they re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes    moviemaking and the political process    is invited   nay   challenged   to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c span when the house is in session      and because we re so utterly   predictably stupid   hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo   washington knows that we won t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies    and deniro s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won t be able to locate albania on the map    the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn t a light   meaningless comedy about politics   like speechless   the michael keaton   geena davis picture   or from the level of light hearted politcal satire to near greatness    nor is it a hard edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally deprived   ethically challenged baby boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house   like primary colors    and yes   i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out   thanks for asking      instead   david mamet s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire    it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers  schemes come off beautifully   and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion    deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables   without any of the violent rages    it s all     what do i love    what is it that brings me joy    baseball     minus the savage bloody beating with the bat    he threatens a lot of people   mind you   but he s doing it in a very nice   polite way    it s a very mellow   restrained performance   which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script    hoffman   on the other hand   is giddy   exuberant and joyous    this kind of thing is what his character lives for   and he s so excited that he can t even shut up    even on the edge of disaster   he s bright eyed   behind oddly tinted sunglasses   and 1itive    insiders note that he s basing his character on some powerful but anonymous producer    which may or may not be true   but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets put on a show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have    the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast    the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them   listen to them talk in that wised up mamet dialogue   get to know them better    which we don t    anne heche   is dead bang on in her portrayal of a political press aide    cool and com1ed on the outside   panicked and frenzied on the outside    denis leary   one of my favorite actors    see the ref   is the   fad king     who handles the profitable   back end      t shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative   innovative ways to separate a fool from his money    they could make a whole movie   just about the fad king   and i d go see it    willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously   from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song   to the weepy country waltz   to the hilarious   ballad of the green berets   parody    woody harrelson has a brief   but memorable part as the overmedicated   hero   of the albanian conflict    craig t   nelson   as the op1ition candidate   and the ever reliable william h   macy   as a wacky cia agent   are given surprisingly short shrift       one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing      wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems   the trivialization of american politics   the role of the press in dumbing down the issues   the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials   the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars    the list goes on    we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens    wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don t    ,1
 as the film opens up   expectant unwed mother sally   played by drew barrymore   encounters her baby s father in a fast food drive through window    after he gets his milkshake   he drives off   only to be pursued by a military helicopter    from this moment forward   you know that this isn t going to be your run of the mill romantic comedy    home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian   played by luke wilson     a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally       more  than he would care to admit   hint   it has something to do with the father of sally s unborn child      after taking a personal   and professional   interest in her   he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works   and the fun goes on from there    this movie is a lot of fun    it is comedic on two levels   as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy    the romantic moments are sweet   yet not sappy    one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes    however   the dark comedic moments are more memorable    this is also a tale of revenge   and a funny one at that    the father of sally s unborn child also happened to be a married man   whose wife is played by catherine o hara    she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair   and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work       my apologies if this sounds cryptic   but there is too much of the plot to give away      rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus   dorian s overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy   dorian s trainer at the fast food restaurant    the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones   even with the romantic nature of the plot    if there are any complaints   it is over drew barrymore s performance    while she does light up the screen   there are moments when she doesn t seem all that convincing    the movie was filmed in texas   and most of the characters have southern texan accents    drew barrymore s accent tends to come and go   luke wilson doesn t seem to have this problem      as well   she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant    still   this movie is one that will please many viewers    with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments   this is sure to entertain    ,1
 the second jackal based film to come out in 1997   the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal     this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland   and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo s own alma matter   concordia university in montreal   canada    the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal   but does not pretend to be 1-1-1% factual    plot   naval officer ramirez   quinn   gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal   in order to put an end to the actual militant s radical activities    he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee    ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this   assignment     and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism   intrigue and double personality syndrome   which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states      critique   great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two hour runtime    admittedly   i wasn t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film   and didn t expect much from this movie beforehand   but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments   as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line    the first hour is mostly just a build up of things to come   and does offer a great characterization of the jackal   but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending    quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal   but didn t offer anything extraordinary   in my opinion    sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they ve played in both of their respective careers of late   but nonetheless   appeared to relish the cold heartedness of their chosen characters    i didn t like performance put forth from quinn s wife in this flick   but then again   she doesn t show up in most of the film   so that wasn t so bad    i did however enjoy director duguay s interesting style and cinematic vision    this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences   but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer    i thought that was neat    having said that   i didn t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was   and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the   fake   jackal met with the   real   jackal s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part   but all in all   not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre    little known facts   ben kingsley s real name is krishna banji   he stands 5   8   was born in scarborough   england   and won the best actor honor in 1982 s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi    many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal   canada   joblo s haven of restfulness      donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland   is canadian   and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal    ,1
 one of the last entries in the long running carry on series   carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a  caravan  site    professors anna vrooshka   elke sommer   and roland crump   kenneth williams   and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep   kenneth connor   so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains    anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick     for instance   when anna is asking for  scrubbers for dirty caravan    she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan !  arthur upmore   bernard bresslaw   and his wife linda   patsy rowlands   take her mother daphne barnes   joan sims   and her minah bird on holiday with them    mother in law jokes prevail    furthermore   the trouble that joe and norma baxter   ian lavender and adrienne 1ta   have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families    fred ramsden   windsor davies   and ernie bragg   jack douglas   leave their wives   liz fraser and patricia franklin   behind for a fishing holiday    however   they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls   sandra   carol hawkins   and carol   sherrie hewson      the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day to day running of the camp   the search for the minah bid and greyhound   the major   fred and ernie s desperate need of a woman   a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park s pub   and a shock in store for daphne    the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing    this is what binds the movie together    joan sims stands out as the demanding mother in law   bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife   and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast    on the other hand   there are low key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman   and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen !  even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman   there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors    although the regular cast is depleted   the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film    a relative flop at the cinema   this movie deserves a lot more recognition    ,1
 the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now     it mu5t be found      so what   exactly   is the fifth element    after seeing luc besson s ambitious   much shrouded in secrecy science fiction fantasy   i could not help but be let down by the actual answer   which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think    but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole   a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do  create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen    the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps  the actual storyline  is the most conventional   dismayingly so   element   pun intended   of the film    speaking in the vaguest 1sible terms   the basics of the plot are as follows   in the year 2259   a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth   and only the four elements  earth   wind   fire   and water  united with a fifth element can stop it    figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas   bruce willis     a shady   southern drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg   the hilariously hammy gary oldman   picking up where he left off in besson s the professional     a priest   ian holm     and a mysterious creature named leeloo   milla jovovich      all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming  and unsurprising  fashion   but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest    what remains interesting and exciting   however   after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil   director of photography thierry arbogast   visual effects supervisor mark stetson   and the crew at digital domain    the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last    the frenzied cityscape of new york   with its vibrant day glo colors   tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds   and the swarm of cars   cabs   and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways   is absolutely breathtaking to behold   especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film    but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren t equally as interesting   and are they ever    in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world   from bulky robots to dog like mangalores   the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean paul gaulthier   best known for creating madonna s pointy bustier get up in her blonde ambition tour    gaulthier s outlandish creations   such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps   feel more at home in besson s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world   they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film    while besson s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film   it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience    for all its imagination   certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre    i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film   ruby rhod   chris tucker     a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative  he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress   sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer   speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed    at first this character s hyper energy is funny   but the act wears out its welcome very quickly    not irritating   but just as strange   is a musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva   maiwenn lebesco     who sings  and dances  an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno    the tune   as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra s innovative score   is haunting   but it is also completely jarring    then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout   which too often are silly and forced   a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny   to boot    the story s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element    while still visually and aurally spectacular   the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be    the big   serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers   and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward    as such   at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here   that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters    this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself   who told me in the lobby following the screening   imagine that   the filmmaker watching the film with the   enemy     the critics   that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half  now titled mr   shadow  is still waiting to be made    still   despite the story problems   the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson   rarely does a filmmaker s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious   undiluted glory    it is a fascinating example of how of one artist s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams    ,1
    very bad things     is the most delightfully morbid film of the year   a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn t help but be won over by the material    the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas    the groom to be is kyle fisher   jon favreau     who is about to be married to the controlling   wedding obsessed laura   cameron diaz      the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd   christian slater     quiet charles   leland orser     and brothers   michael   jeremy piven   and family man adam   daniel stern      after a wild night of gambling   boozing   and drugs   a stripper   carla scott   who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room   but after a freak accident   to everyone s terror   she is killed    as robert puts it     there are two options   go to the police and go to prison   or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her      after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body   robert is forced to kill him as well       okay   there is only one option now    you can forget about calling the police     he says    by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer   most of them are overcome with guilt   which sets off an even more elaborate series of event   that includes much   much more murder   double crosses   and the inevitable wedding from hell       very bad things     which is actor peter berg s feature film directing debut   is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that     there s something about mary     wanted to be    it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh   original   and hilarious   even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence   gore   and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end    the screenplay   also written by berg   is   to put it mildly   very funny and courageous    during the second act of the film   some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death   which was beginning to undermine the humor   but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed    the dialogue is edgy and inventive   and this film proves that a movie doesn t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable    there s more fun   i think   in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts    cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here   and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura   who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends    diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january    by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger   and reciting lines like     stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs     i couldn t help but crack up at how   balls to the wall   this film had become    jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original   as daniel stern s wife   who late in the picture   we discover   is a tough kick boxer that should not be messed around with    it is at this level that     very bad things     was so entertaining and surprising    just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen   there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky    the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over the top    although i enjoyed the film immensely   let me make this clear     very bad things     is not a movie for everyone    it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen   it is more violent and bloody than a r rated film usually is   and it is offensive    luckily   these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy   since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no holds barred   politically incorrect comedy    the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and   safe   wide releases coming out lately   still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry    ,1
 it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive   so delicate   so insightful and yes   even so enjoyable    somehow   the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through    set in the 194-1 s   the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells   tobey maguire   ride with the devil      an orphan   twice rejected as an infant by 1sible adoptive parents   he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr   wilbur larch   michael caine   little voice     father figure to the orphans of st   cloud   obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help    figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage   he might as well be of use   dr   larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics    soon homer is delivering babies like a professional    he refuses to perform abortions   instead wondering why the couples just didn t behave more responsibly    larch   too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals   marvels that homer   continues to have such high expectations of people      such is the result of an insulated upbringing    though skilled in certain medical procedures   homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else    he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world   he must go out into it    befriending a young couple who had come to see dr   larch   he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived    thus   homer begins his worldly instruction   with new friend candy kendall   charlize theron   the astronaut s wife   a willing tutor    tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life s questions        many of which he was unaware needed to be asked    he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing    michael caine is   in a word   brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans   many of whom he helped to bring into the world    calling them   princes of maine   kings of new england   in his ritualistic goodnight   mr   caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine    delroy lindo   a life less ordinary   has many powerful moments as mr   rose   the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins    director lasse hallstrom   what s eating gilbert grape     and screenwriter/novelist john irving   the world according to garp     who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter    regardless of one s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion   it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers    the title is a reference to a list of rules 1ted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers    figuring the rules didn t apply to them since they didn t have a hand in writing them   they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along    dr   larch   in his own way   acts similarly    there is a danger in that line of reasoning    god has also given us a set of rules    unlike the list 1ted in the cider house   god s rules   if followed   promise us benefits beyond our imagination    and yet   many continue to ignore his   rules   preferring to make up their own as they go through life       trust in the lord with all thine heart   and lean not unto thine own understanding      proverbs 3   5 [kjv]  just as a builder follows a designer s blueprint or a conductor follows a com1er s score   why shouldn t we follow the rules of life given to us by life s architect for our own blessing    ,1
 known as the most successful   highest grossing romantic comedy in history   director garry marshall apparently struck gold with   pretty woman     which opened quietly during the summer of 199-1 but   thanks to 1itive word of mouth   was able to reach upwards of $175 million in theaters alone    the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film s two charismatic stars   richard gere and julia roberts   since the story itself is none too original or even believable    the other winning element that makes   pretty woman   so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence   which is rarely as palpable in today s films as it is here    edward lewis   richard gere   is a suave   extremely wealthy business mogul who   at the start of the picture   breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument   and abruptly takes his friend s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel    stopping the car along the street   he asks a woman   obviously a prostitute   for directions    agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks   edward ultimately accepts   they strike up a conversation   and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor    this meeting does not lead to sex   however   as edward confides that he d rather just have someone to talk to   and offers her $3-1-1 to spend the night    just as well   since the hooker   named vivian   is a beautiful   generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear    the meeting between these two completely op1ite people does not end the next morning as planned   when edward finally offers to pay vivian three thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area   keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get togethers    since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips   which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers   the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act   edward and vivian will finally   truly   kiss    allegedly planned as a grim   downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director     pretty woman   has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale   a la   cinderella      the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have 1sibly been    you honestly don t need a high iq   or any iq   for that matter   to guess how the film will end   and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha    the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less than gratifying   and the screenplay is no award winner    and yet   amidst all of these qualms and flaws     pretty woman   is an astoundingly charming motion picture   and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers    you d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go   and there are a few select moments   not even whole scenes   mind you   that are as romantic as anything i ve seen on film in the 199-1 s    additionally   the film belongs   and its success can be attributed   to two people and two people only   and they are richard gere and julia roberts    playing sex symbols throughout the  8-1s with such pictures as   american gigolo   and   an officer and a gentleman     gere branches out here to play a more quiet   almost shy   but still alluring   character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet   and vice versa    julia roberts   in her breakthrough role after 1988 s well received   mistic pizza   and 1989 s   steel magnolia     for which she was nominated for an academy award   is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian   who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers   not for her line of work   but more for her sheer intelligence    it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake   but screenwriter j   f   lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing    after   pretty woman     roberts   along with meg ryan   became the reigning queen of romantic comedies   with her latest being the just released   runaway bride     which repairs gere and roberts together once again     and no wonder    roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy   but also one who can efficiently do drama   and in almost every film she appears in   it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co star    an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co workers that vivian is actually a prostitute   and he then approaches her   making sexual advances    no only does this make vivian feel cheap   especially since she had previously been 1ing as a more professional   eloquent young lady   but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way   and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading   and if she likes this particular path    on the more dreamy side   the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold   especially one in which edward enters into the hotel s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress   but also her inner   and outer   glowing beauty    another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward   who is asleep   and placing it on his lips   since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days       pretty woman   does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene   which is a happy ending   as you d expect   and wouldn t have it any other way   that somehow does not work   perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances    this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film   though   because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem    helped along by a warm   memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo   as vivian s best friend and roommate   and a fabulously catchy soundtrack   in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie s overall fulfillment     pretty woman   is a sparkler of a motion picture   and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy    ,1

 this remake of   la cage aux folles   features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son s future in laws    the couple   robin williams and nathan lane   are about as archetypal   or as the less kind might put it   stereotypical   gays 1sible    williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star    they live above the club in what could not 1sibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode    williams is excellent as should be no surprise    gene hackman as right wing potential father in law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles    the real star is lane    his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight shooting uncle is hilarious    perhaps it is a personal failing on my part   but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it    luckily   for me at least     it doesn t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men   their son and the deception    the question of stereotypes is a touchy one    these guys personify the homophobic gay image    you can almost hear the swishing    if you think that they are sup1ed to be representative of every gay man in the world   you ll be outraged    but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals   you ll love it    your choice    ,1
 seen may 19   1999 at 5 p   m   at the crossgates cinema 18   guilderland   n   y       theater #1   with my brother john for $8   5-1    [theater rating   * * * *   excellent seats   sound and picture]     critic s note   this review is the longest i ve ever written and still only scratches the surface    i d recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis      as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace    how do i even write this review    never mind the fact that i ve been waiting for a new `star wars  movie since i was seven years old    never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released    never mind that there s so much going on in this movie in terms of plot   action   special effects and long term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn t cover everything    and also like ted does in all of his reviews   i ll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as 1sible as if i was talking directly to you   the reader    before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film   many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered   to get the specifics of the film   skip this and the next four paragraphs      as has been made obvious for the last several years   another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars  series   the first of the films was actually episode four   not one      george lucas   the creator of the series   has probably just assumed most people know the first produced trilogy   `star wars     `the empire strikes back  and `return of the jedi    is actually the second trilogy   chronologically    in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order   but i can t recall his reasons    with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy   err        second trilogy        well you know what i mean      and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which   unfortunately   may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution    [critic s note #1   it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed   but it would be nearly im1sible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule    critic s note #2   reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics  law of reviewing movies   which as roger ebert coined   `it s not what a movie is about   but how it is about it      because so many outside factors come into play in the film s plot and significance as part of a trilogy   and just considering modern society   it again would be difficult   if not im1sible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story   ]  first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it    we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker   who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire    we know obi wan `ben  kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force  in attempts to become a jedi knight   but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side      we also know something about `the force  itself   that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it   the jedi      what we don t know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy   which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth    to me   this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle   definite order to all the complexity    also   it seems that we re sup1ed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended    most notably   details regarding the emperor from `empire  and `jedi     and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine    for those who haven t kept up with all the `star wars  paraphernalia over the years   there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor   or his voice at least      with `the phantom menace  being the first chapter of a long saga   one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid   including the history behind all the major factors of the series   especially `the force  and the jedi knights    unfortunately   this film does more of the op1ite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained    i didn t liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness    if you re going to tell a story from the beginning   tell it from the beginning   is it 1sible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes  1 through  3 to clarify the back story even further        but i digress    i ve said so much and yet i haven t even touched on the specifics of the film itself    all these necessary `disclaiming  elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars  series is and this individual film itself    what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we ve come to know and love since the late 197-1s    its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar   but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality    the basic story is rather sorted   complex and even confusing at times    we re told that an army known as `the trade federation  has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo    we re not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their pur1e is   instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly    we re introduced to two jedi   the master qui gon jinn   neeson   and his apprentice obi wan kenobi   mcgregor      the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet s queen   amidala   portman      the leader of the federation   an alien called viceroy   is following the orders of a strange   mythical character   an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears    he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance   and especially that creepy evil voice of his   he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series    sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person    clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity   which is never openly revealed in the film   but should be clear to most viewers    i have a feeling we ll delve into his background in the next two films      but it doesn t take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film s story begins to move along    the film doesn t have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini plot and adventure on top of another    there are so many of these mini plots within plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook    the other films have relied on this type of storytelling   but because of the limits of the technology at the time   the films  screenplays were also limiting    the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace  its unique traits    as we already know   the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars  trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story    and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 1-1 year old anakin skywalker   lloyd     by qui gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council    to briefly summarize the story   jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala s spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation    their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force    jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force   and through another sub plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter   more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves    this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before    in fact   it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before    the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary    by the film s third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot    it s funny how the reality of the `star wars  world seems so embedded in mythology   new age like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence    not that this technique hasn t been used in movies and in real life situations countless times throughout history    and at least it s all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter    it does border of the cartoonish sometimes   but that s just the film appealing to our inner child   which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society    `the phantom menace  delivers exactly what you d expect from a `star wars  film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness    so many things in the film we ve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited    but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies    ,1
 the story of us   a rob reiner film   is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film   as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films    well   1999 has two of them   the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family   american beauty    the story of us   a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family   is a well written   heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience   including myself   cry    the story of us tells the story of ben   bruce willis   and katie   michelle pfeiffer   jordan   and asks the question     can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage      the film is about two individuals who have come together   spent a good chunk of their lives together   and shows when our main characters are   him   and   her     during the bad times     and when they are   us     during the good times      the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day    ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer   or at least say they don t   love each other anymore    ben   a cartoonist   and katie   a crossword puzzle writer   have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage   as they have grown to follow different views on life   family   and marriage    katie is the more organized   sophisticated type   who wants to plan everything out   while ben is a spontaneous   adventurous individual who doesn t mind doing things differently than they were planned    the story of us plays out nicely   as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist   told to the viewer through flashbacks    as the film progresses   it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist   with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage    this method is highly effective   as we see the characters changing from year to year   slowly growing apart    through the flashbacks   we get to see the story of them through both of the character s eyes   and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like   as the story of us has three dimensional   believable main characters    the screenplay   written by jessie nelson   stepmom   and alan zweibel   dragnet     is a touching   down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer   much like another one of nelson s films   stepmom    the script has an open honesty and outlook on life   one that is so realistic   you feel uncomfortable at many times   because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar   as most families these days most go through the hard times   as ben and katie must    if it wasn t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote   which are rugged and certainly flawed   the story of us would have been this year s best picture    bruce willis   a usual action/adventure star   has certainly turned himself around in the past year  he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies   to a distinguished   sophisticated actor   as in last summer s the sixth sense   and now in the story of us   willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script    although i wouldn t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan   willis handles himself nicely   and shines in a few of the film s most powerful scenes   enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season    where to start about michelle pfeiffer    pfeiffer s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong   as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion   you wonder how   how it is 1sible for someone to portray a real person with such realism    pfeiffer s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring   will be in the heart s of any viewer that has watched this moving film    the story of us is one of 1999 s most real   yet funny films   as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked    superb acting   direction   writing   story   and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film   which is beautifully com1ed by eric clapton and marc shaiman   make the story of us a touching   unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country  and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall    the film s major high points are the fights between ben and katie   as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed   and although they also say things like   it s over     or   i hate you     you can tell the two still share a deep connection   and that inside   somewhere   they are still an   us      the bottom line   a wonderful   enchanting   and heartbreaking film    one of the most realistic   heartbreaking films in recent years    ,1
 warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest   craziest and hard hitting movie in his career    based on a story concocted by himself   and also written by beatty   bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system    beatty stars as senator jay bulworth   who s going through a nervous breakdown    after hiring someone to kill him   he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what s  really  happening in american politics   much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy   platt      instead of everyone hating him   the american public love him    however   inside his party   more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin    and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina   berry      it s remarkable that this film was released at all    much more open than the rather subdued primary colours   bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name    the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny   and also somewhat true    it s great that beatty isn t afraid to let loose on a subject    talking of beatty   he s excellent in the role of the demented senator   clearing having fun    and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed    even in dick tracy   he was the most straighten face actor       then again   he was the only characters face we could completely see      the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping   which he does with gusto   and also quite well      and seeing beatty as a  homeboy  has to be seen to be believed    it s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself    second best is oliver platt as the flustered   coke snorting assistant   who goes over the top when he finally snaps    halle berry is fine   and sexy   as the intellectual nina   who comes to like the senator    also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent   laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she s also played   and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife   who all contribute to the fun    and   this being a political film   the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance   as   * shock *   himself    the writing and directing   both by beatty   are above par    the direction is very nearly sitcom like   but suits the film perfectly   and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well    the script is funny   and the raps are actually well produced and humorous   and quite clever    they re not cringe inducing   at least    the script makes many points about society in america today   and isn t afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system    best of all   the film is thought provoking   but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather   and is very entertaining    there s also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes    bulworth is a film with many advantages   and few flaws    perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping   but beatty does it so well it s irrelevant    in fact   there s very little against bulworth   except for the language which is very heavy   but then again it should be expected    bulworth   then   is well worth watching    a david wilcock review   1999     you know   for kids     norville barnes  ,1
 the long and illustrious career of robin williams   which has included both forgettable turns like mrs    doubtfire and flubber   was punctuated with the actor s first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting    it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989 s dead poets society   and critical remarks were unanimously 1itive    his next role   that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come   was unfortunately lackluster    and so   after a six year stint as a comedic actor   the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams    williams is the title character   hunter   patch   adams   sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting    we re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies    it s at the institution   however   that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people    he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia s medical college   where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating   impersonal trade    his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion   and the movie climaxes with patch s appearance before the state medical board    the characters are well defined in an oscar worthy sense    although the script does not perform well as a narrative    there s little story to be told outside of patch s skit length experiences    the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters    at medical school   patch meets up with truman schiff   daniel london     an outsider like himself who relishes patch s zest for humanity    the two instantly become the best of friends   and it s easy to see why    monica potter plays patch s love interest   a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school    for some reason he s attracted to her   and although it never gets said   the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view    the script    based on hunter adams  own story    works well this way    the rest of the cast   bob gunton as the villain professor in particular   is solid    director tom shadyac   liar liar   leads us in and out of patch s life in a sound   intentional manner   combined with williams  presence on screen   the movie rarely becomes boring    patch adams  lack of pur1e is its major shortcoming   and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours   there s little feeling of continuity or the passage of time    nevertheless   it s an emotionally moving picture   and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season    it succeeds at everything it tries   and only fails at the stuff it doesn t try in the first place    by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams   but more importantly   it s entertainment for the entire family    ,1
 in recent years   harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence   scowling through the likes of tom clancy s jack ryan series    the fugitive    and last year s smash  air force one    that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system    apparently   it was just lying dormant    with ivan reitman s enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure  six days    seven nights    the lovable scoundrel is back   giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons    ford plays quinn harris   a carefree and slightly slobby   endearingly so   pilot in the tropics whose broken down plane crashes in a storm   stranding him and his charter   new york magazine editor robin monroe   anne heche     on a deserted island    of course   the sophisticated robin and the salt of the earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down   and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting    while some of the lines fall flat   the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche    both actors   who have largely done serious works as of late   seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders   and they deliver their zingers   as weak as they sometimes are   with beguiling abandon    naturally   there s nothing like a life threatening crisis to bring two people together   and quinn and robin s warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates    granted   some conflict needed to be introduced on the island   but this tacked on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the pur1e of adding gratuitous action scenes    but the point is to get the two together   and their newfound affection causes complications for both   but mostly robin   who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank   david schwimmer     who frantically awaits her return on the home island    reitman   and old   reliable hand at breezy comedies   keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action oriented sequences    his big accomplishment   however   is bringing the old   smiling ford back    as appealing and charismatic as he always is   ford hasn t been quite this charming and affable in years   he s obviously having a blast   and the audience cannot help but have one along with him    holding her own is heche   whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be   as the plane goes down   she frantically pops stress pills      she can take her lumps   physical and otherwise   just as well as quinn   making her a formidable foil and ideal match    formulaic and light as a feather    six days    seven nights  could be cited as a classic example of the summer   popcorn   movie season s lack of substance    it s certainly fluff   but it s unpretentious   undemanding   and  most importantly  fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach    pass the popcorn    ,1
 near the end of 1996   analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king    the following year   1997   saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom   twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia    at best   that s all it was    a sleeper hit   designed to surprise but not shake the industry    in 1998   however   things have been decidedly different    there have been a number of pushes on disney s death grip on the market   and fifty one weeks into  98   a new champion has emerged    dreamworks  the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed    the other two contenders   warner brothers  quest for camelot and disney s own annual entry   mulan   lacked inspiration and drive respectively    although camelot was borderline abysmal   and can t really be considered a shot at the title   mulan had the makings of winner    unfortunately   it was saturated with traditional   disney cute animation   and lost points against the rapidly changing face of the competition    in making the prince of egypt   dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product    the animation is flawless   and   aside from a bug s life   is the best looking movie to date    the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects   and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with    the key to success   however   was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot    namely   some of the most important action sequences   like the parting of the red sea   were done almost entirely in 3d    dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ve got the stuff of success   and that they re capable of challenging disney    the story is also well written   and the characters voiced with talent    for the most part   the plot follows its source material    the book of exodus    although only in the most general sense    the writers took a few creative liberties   and most do not damage the story in any way    in fact   the shakespearean relationship between moses   val kilmer   and the pharaoh rameses   ralph fiennes   makes the story more interesting if anything    moses   a hebrew   is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile   he floats into the pharaoh seti   patrick stewart    s palace and is taken in by the royal family    moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert   where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves    by this time   rameses is now pharaoh   and the two brothers   now on op1ite sides of the line   face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention    the cast of voices is most impressive   and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock   jeff goldblum   danny glover   and steve martin    the script does not have a lot of one liners in it   and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams   but overall the story is exciting and interesting    it s decidedly for an older crowd   and the tykes who haven t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost    but for those who make the bid   the prince of egypt can be a great watch    ,1
 capsule   a rock and roll fable   indeed    like a hubert selby   jr   novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen   and a ton of fun    streets of fire bills itself as   a rock and roll fable     and the description is perfect    this is a stylish   great looking   and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby   jr     novel with a damon runyan rewrite   irected by bruce springsteen    noir is one of the few truly american movie genres   aside from the hollywood musical and the western    this is 1t wwii brooklyn noir   for lack of a better label   with a generous injection of rock  n roll and an all around confrontational attitude    it all works    the plot is simplicity itself   rocker ellen aim   diane lane   is kidnapped by a vicious street gang   led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven   willem dafoe   very nasty      her old soldier flame   played by michael pare   comes back into town to save her   but doesn t count on a whole bunch of things going askew    that s about the entire plot   save for the spats with ellen s manager   a hilarious rick moranis     an encounter with a doo wop group that winds up becoming ellen s supporting act   and a whole gang of other fun little touches    but in movies like this   when is the plot important    the movie is all style   all visuals and attitudes   quotable lines and 1turing    and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing    no surprise that it was directed by walter hill   48 hrs       who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly   and has put together a movie that s a mixture of times and sensibilities   but perfectly unified in tone    when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie   especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw   * and * passes out   every 2   63 minutes on cue    streets of fire isn t the greatest movie ever made   but it occupies a totally unique little niche   and enjoys the 1ition it has    anyone with a weakness for doo wop   neon   motorcycles   rainy streets   the el   studebakers   gang pictures   lonely heroes   and a great looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up    i did    ,1
 jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities   but whom you end up liking anyway    in as good as it gets   the character in question is melvin udall   a successful novelist with obsessive compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as 1sible   except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you know where    he s mean    i mean really mean    the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium    every day   melvin eats at the same cafe   sits at the same table   and gets served by the same waitress    you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance   when his waitress carol   helen hunt   tells him he can just go sit in another section   and all the other waitresses just cringe    one day   melvin makes a comment that goes to far   and carol   genuinely hurt   comes down on him like a ton of bricks    at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course   but is also the only person who can get to him   too    another person who often crosses melvin s sights is simon   greg kinnear     an artist who lives on melvin s floor    aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city   simon has the added benefit of being gay   making him a prime target    simon s friend frank   cuba gooding   jr       also gay   does not fare much better    when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment   he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital   and frank   who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor   intimidates melvin into watching after simon s dog while he convalesces    this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage    an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in   melvin gets to like the dog   and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin s softening up to the world around him    it doesn t happen overnight   but throughout the film   he bites his tongue here   cares a little there   and most miraculously   falls in love    one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual -1ative ones he so often shares with others    he s traveling terra incognita here   and it shows    good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film   especially by nicholson and hunt    they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen    greg kinnear   who is becoming known for his supporting film roles   is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon    he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist   and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels    cuba gooding jr   performs with a hyped up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear   and comes through with a near constant comic performance    the screenplay   by mark andrus and james l   brooks   is clever   touching   and funny    the best part about it   however   is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting    melvin is a man we can t quite figure out   but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention    carol is a working woman living with her mother   trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem    simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers   but who is still not accepted by much of society    combined with the talent of the actors   these characters make the film    the one noticeable area where the film is lacking   however   is the absence of cuba gooding   jr   through the second half    his character makes an exit which is sup1ed to be temporary   but the film ends before his return   leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved    i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general   in addition to a part in the film s conclusion    there s one actor   who will probably not be recognized by any awards   but who contributes greatly to many of the movie s best scenes and who deserves mention    this is that little dog    he plays such a pivotal role to melvin s character development   actually serves to forward the plot   and has some absolutely scene stealing moments   that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal    award or no   however   when even the dog puts in a good performance   you know you ve got an outstanding movie    ,1

 with storytelling this compelling   who needs books    based on the book by author james ellroy   l   a   confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years    together with director curtis hanson   the hand that rocks the cradle   the river wild   whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film   resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight   an atom would have to squeeze itself through    set in the 5-1s   the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities    jack vincennes   spacey   is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style   concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention    there is also the young hot shot rookie   ed exley   pearce     fresh out of the academy and all out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father    the tough and unnerving bud white   crowe     a cop who believes in justice   the swift and violent way    3 policemen   distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil    when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation   bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder    even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case   happenings began to link itself to the murder    the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised crime in hollywood    the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects    in l   a   confidential   you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story  going for it    there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all    surprisingly   though spacey did a very convincing job as the street wise vincennes   the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns    pearce and crowe    pearce s exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance    crowe s bud white is the most impressive of all   head strong and temperamental   he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here    superb acting     wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever    easily the best hollywood piece for 1997    ,1

 with more and more television shows having gay characters   and even the infamous   ellen   sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian   the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines    the birdcage was critically acclaimed   as was this years chasing amy    then along came in & out   and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released    it s also noticeable that this   alternative lifestyle   becomes less and less taboo as the years go by   and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort    while it s a very serious issue to many   it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety    but the way we re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically    while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at *   it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with *   and when a movie like in & out comes along   it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy    it doesn t poke fun at the lifestyle   it simply uses it to all it s comedic capacity   just as love   sex   marriage   birth   death   and anything else has been    the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids afflicted gay man in philadelphia    if you remember   during his acceptance speech   hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community   and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life    it s a serious and touchy subject   but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy   and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick    it s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual   it may have been more controversial   but because it was written by an openly gay writer   the prerogative was set    kevin kline   who only seems to become more and more acclaimed   stars as howard brackett   a high school english teacher in the small   picturesque town of greenleaf   indiana    after a three year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery   joan cusack     a wedding date has been set   and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story   greenleaf high graduate cameron drake   matt dillon   is up for a best actor oscar    the small town eagerly awaits both events   and both seem quite astronomical   but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other    when cameron drake is announced the winner   the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher   mr   brackett    everyone is cheering back in greenleaf   that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words     and he s gay      the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop    the thing is   nobody   including howard   can understand how cameron came to that conclusion   and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf    naturally the questions pour from howard s fiancee   parents   debbie reynolds & wilford brimley     students   and the high school s principal   tom halliwell   bob newhart     and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious   howard is clean   neat   honest   sincere   a romantic   and perhaps the most incriminating fact   he loves barbara streisand    the frenzy isn t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and   entertainment tonight   wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning    one particular reporter is peter malloy   tom selleck   of   inside entertainment     who unlike the collage of other reporters   wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett   including coverage of his wedding    the intrusion is all but welcome by howard   who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute    it seems that no matter where he turns   a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees    the dominoes begin to tumble as howard s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a 1sible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay    it all sounds very devastating   and it would be if it weren t presented with near perfection by one of this year s most delightful ensemble casts    kline seems only to improve with age   and he is downright perfect here    the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine   and they use it wonderfully    every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever    dillon has never been so likeable   cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role   and brimley   reynolds   and newhart all provide huge laughs when they re up to bat    rudnick s script is heavily laced with wit and humor   and you ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes    while in & out doesn t carry enough to give it four stars   it remains one of the best done films of the year   all around    the script is exuberant   the actors are absolutely top  notch   and we re allowed just the perfect blend of heart tugging so as not to bog down the laughs    it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety   yet we re still allowed a sappily touching ending    despite it s subject matter   and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex   this is a movie that everyone could   and should   enjoy    frank oz   best known as a voice talent for muppets   directs this film quite delightfully   using all the potential rudnick s script has to offer   which turns out to be quite a bit    check this one out    you ll have a gay old time    ,1
 with his last two films   shine and snow falling on cedars   australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there   and his latest   hearts in atlantis   is no different    its structure   beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle   is similar to the green mile   which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books    the parallels don t end there   either    atlantis was adapted by william goldman   who had previously penned the big screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king s dreamcatcher    even the film s content is a bit reminiscent of mile    in fact   it s the perfect blend of the feel good  6-1s nostalgia of stand by me   also by king   and mystical power hokum of mile    king s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories   but the main focus here is on the first   and longest   tale   called low men in yellow coats   the film s title comes from the second chapter      it s set in 196-1 harwich   connecticut   where 11 year old bobby garfield   anton yelchin   lives in a boarding house run by his cold   self centered mother elizabeth   hope davis   joe gould s secret     who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son    bobby spends his time with his two closest friends   john sullivan   will rothhaar   and tomboy carol gerber   mika boorem     who become something like the kevin   paul and winnie of harwich    when a new tenant moves into the vacant room   the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan   anthony hopkins   hannibal     a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror    ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature   after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday     dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men   a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers    i won t go into what these powers are   but they re considerably toned down from the book   and don t involve black stuff flying out of ted s mouth   a la mile      atlantis  present day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel s final chapter   titled heavenly shades of night are falling   and features david morse   in yet another connection to the green mile   as a married   middle aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years    atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks  cedars   which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski   the oscar nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski s red    the acting is solid from everyone   including hopkins   who never once makes you think of dr   lecter    most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem   who both had tiny parts in along came a spider    while i didn t really have much of a problem with goldman s screenplay   i do need to point out at least one inconsistency    goldman   for those of you who don t read premiere   writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else s films   carefully explaining why they all suck   make no sense and insult their audiences   while somehow failing to mention the crap that he s penned   like the general s daughter      it s mean spirited but fun to read   mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely -1ative about anybody else in the business   including michael jackson   o   j    and robert blake      in atlantis   which is sup1ed to be told through the eyes of young bobby   one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back    well   he s not   and it doesn t make sense    1   41   pg 13 for violence and thematic elements  ,1

industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns   eventually topping $1-1-1 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history   while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre    the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry    suddenly   everybody was looking for hip   inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes    the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost    scream director wes craven   previously best known as the creator of new line s a nightmare on elm street film series   was thrust back into the limelight    and scream s rookie scribe   kevin williamson   burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion    it s hard to understate this last point    mr   williamson has   based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing   scream   i know what you did last summer from october 1997   and now scream 2     enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame   quickly become the most well known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly reading   box office figure watching youth culture since    well   since that quentin tarantino guy   whom   it is said   has also achieved some renown as a director      indeed   in a singularly freakish oddity   it is the screenwriter   mr   williamson   and not the director that has been receiving the lion s share of acclaim for the success of scream   and the print advertisements for scream 2 s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence   while the traditional   a film by wes craven   drapes the film s title in the ads   right below it   in equal sized font   yet   reads   written by kevin williamson     an affirmation of the screenwriter s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented       i can envision the board of wga   licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of   a film by   is attained      and   much like mr   tarantino s screenwriting   mr   williamson s work is vaguely unconventional   incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters    in scream   they satirically discussed other horror films   here in the sequel   the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels    scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood   and mr   williamson s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel    while the sequel was planned from the outset    a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr   williamson sold the screenplay for scream    the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived   and it s only at about the film s midway point when it becomes engaging    like its predecessor   scream 2 opens with a splashy   eye grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film s principal narrative   this time around   we re following the exploits of a young couple   jada pinkett and omar epps   attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab   a running film within a film gag where the   true life   events behind the first film has been turned into a movie      however   although it tries hard and has some good ideas    the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with   and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes    the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore   where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act   but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i ve ever seen      there are too many knowing   hip pop culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence   and the setup isn t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream s   while the first film s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying   the payoff here is almost campily theatrical    flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college   where returning characters sidney   neve campbell   and randy   jamie kennedy   have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film    the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors    single minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers   courteney cox   roars into town to cover the breaking story   while ever awkward former deputy dewey riley   david arquette   flies in to protectively guard over sidney    they re joined by cotton weary   liev schreiber     who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film   his role here is significantly expanded    the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory   although i sup1e a good case can be made that it really isn t necessary    not because so many people have seen the first installment   but because this is   after all   a sequel to a slasher film   what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie    there s a lot of new faces on the scene too   sidney s new boyfriend   derek   jerry o connell   and her new roommate hallie   elise neal     randy s fellow film student mickey   timothy olyphant     gale s newly assigned nervous cameraman joel   duane martin     omnipresent local journalist debbie salt   laurie metcalf     co ed cici cooper   ms   buffy herself   sarah michelle gellar     and a pair of simpering sorority sisters   rebecca gayheart and sirens  portia di rossi      any of these characters could be the killer    or for that matter   could be the next victim    as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay   the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly flimsy premise of a whodunit    one problem that scream didn t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer    here   and to some extent in i know what you did last summer     mr   williamson s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery    the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements       it doesn t help matters any that the killer s alter ego is fairly obvious from the get go      indeed   the finale plays as full out camp when the villain is finally unmasked   frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes    this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations   scheming   and motivation   that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it    while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived   the aspect where it s head and shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences    they re staged much more imaginatively here   save for the first 1t prologue murder   which is handled in such a mediocre   conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 198-1s slasher flicks that the first film satirized     and are much more fun to watch    it s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck   and a cat and mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged   although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown    in terms of its characters   the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey   who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music      their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour    an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well written    and there s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed    on the other hand   sidney is pretty dull here    she doesn t have any compelling presence   and there s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she s the returning heroine    given this   and the fact that there s no strong second banana character for sidney   elise neal s role isn t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan s shoes     it s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film    what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast    the film s mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe   well   * almost *     while in principal i applaud this bold policy   at some point you ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel       i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular   whose casting for the next installment of the series would ve seemed obvious      but hey   as rose mcgowan s character said in the first film     no   please don t kill me   mr   ghostface    i want to be in the sequel !    look what that got her    ,1
 note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    it s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth    the lion king had just cracked $3-1-1 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history   continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast    since then   though   disney s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns   with pocahontas   the hunchback of notre dame   and this year s hercules successively proving less and less potent    with the once seemingly impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable   and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox s anastasia   disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation   the little mermaid    while the animation for the film is   as is typically the case for disney films   unquestionably top notch   the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation   but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music    the film s storyline is fairly straightforward    young teen falls for handsome man   father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter   teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man    except in this case   the chaperone is a crab   the teen is a young mermaid   and the object of her desire is a human prince    what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions    from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric   she s resolutely smitten   and she s such a pure and endearing character that one can t help but invest their heart with her    this simple but touching love story   coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour   makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture    one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it   the voices cast for its motley crew of characters    this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue   which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams  much heralded turn in aladdin   by the release of the lion king and henceforth   the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities    while it s understandable that animated features lacking the name recognition or drawing power of disney   say   balto s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda   or even anastasia s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack   would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products   it s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy    do we really need to hear   say   demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame    is the film s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice   rather than a voice which best suits the role       i m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan      fortunately   the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid   although perhaps more obscure   are impeccably cast    chief among them is jodi benson   a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you   who voices the film s heroine ariel to perfection   with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor   and gorgeous singing voice   ms   benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film       she s the only reason i d even consider catching flubber      similarly   samuel e   wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian   the weary guardian crab    he easily milks his lovable character s comic moments for all they re worth   and his rendering of two of the little mermaid s big tunes      under the sea   and   kiss the girl      have become the stuff of legend    pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea witch ursula   while kenneth mars  booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel s father   king triton    in large roles and small   edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal   and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef     the little mermaid is impeccably cast    of course   the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs com1ed by the songwriting team of alan menken   music   and howard ashman   lyrics     who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to com1e beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr   ashman s untimely death    not only are mr   menken s tunes unbearably catchy   but mr   ashman s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character s dialogue   and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film    mr   menken s score for the film is equally top notch   the sequence where eric   voiced by christopher daniel barnes   and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr   menken s fine score    it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso styled   under the sea   as joyfully crooned by mr   wright   which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song    indeed   one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune    but my favourite is ms   benson s heartfelt rendition of the ballad   part of your world     an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope   wonderfully lyricized by mr   ashman   which   accompanied by the film s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence   packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes    during the song s reprise   which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in   the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking   and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history    as of this writing   november 1997 has come to an end   as has disney s limited 17 day re release of the little mermaid    there s no question that the primary motivation for   if not the film s reissue itself   at least its timing   was to reinforce disney s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture   anastasia    in every respect   the re release of the little mermaid appears to be a success    the film s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $1-1-1 million mark   the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video   pulling in close to $1-1 million in its opening weekend   and although nobody could 1sibly expect the little mermaid to 1sibly defeat the aggressively marketed anastasia in head to head competition   it siphoned enough from the fox film s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot   allowing for disney s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away    but although disney s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self serving and protectionist   the real winner is the public    any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one   and it s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen    the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney s modern animation renaissance   and one of the greatest animated films ever made    ,1

 in intolerance   d   w   griffith told four different historical stories at the same time   cutting from one to the other    each of the stories builds to a fast paced climax    in magnolia   paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others    yet the stories and where they are going are all independent    what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized    each story builds to a tense moment   or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment   but then lets the tension dissolve    while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along   even though they are not in the same scene    then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again    it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked    this creates some strange effects    the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships    the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content    we have the story of a dying man earl partridge   jason robards   wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends    phil parma   philip seymour hoffman   is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal    partridge s young wife linda   julianne moore   is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies   but for an unsuspected reason    frank mackey   tom cruise   runs the kinds of self help seminar that businesses like so much   but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women s lib    officer jim kurring   john c   reilly   is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place    jimmy gator   philip baker hall   hosts a popular children s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector   jeremy blackman   and former quiz kid donnie smith   william h   macy      the film juggles all these stories for over three hours   but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily    each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax   but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story    the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories    the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history   but it really has little to do with the content of the stories   though they all are connected in part by one weird event    magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson   though in my opinion his two previous films   hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories    it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson s company    john c   reilly seems to be a standard fixture    particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight    here he several of the characters are mesmerizing   but that characteristic is not really used    as studies of characters these stories are each worth following    as well rounded stories with a beginning   middle and end   they leave something to be desired    but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through    i rate it a 7 on the -1 to 1-1 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen    and in actual fact   it does    since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods    it is   however   a perfectly natural   if somewhat unnerving   phenomenon    the cause is associated with whirlwinds    we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air   holding them aloft    the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister    smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are    when the whirlwind is over water   animals near the surface   frequently fish and frogs   may suffer the same fate    essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind   held aloft by updrafts   and finally dropped elsewhere    so while the rain is 1sible   some doubts do creep in    the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs    it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped    it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon       frankly i have no idea on these points      otherwise the event was quite believable    what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano    in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8   2       and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people   and upon all thy servants      however a rain of frogs   though it feels biblical   is most definitely not a biblical portent    note that the previous verse says   and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up            so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river    the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16   13    ,1
 contact is the 1997 movie i ve seen the most   five times to be exact    four of those times were on the big screen   but even on a tv   it s a very impressive film    the same can t be said for films like independance day   but that s because contact is a rare example in sci fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects   and all of us know looking back that id4 didn t offer much outside of some one time delightful eye candy    contact s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway   jodie foster     a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of   merely listening   to sounds out in space    her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age   encouraged by her loving father   ted   david morse     who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola   fl   that was   of course   before the days of internet chat rooms      while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra terrestrial intelligence   of which the program seti is an acronym for     ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on   keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive    ellie s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist   a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young    in puerto rico   she meets palmer joss   matthew mcconaughey     a writer examining the effects of technology on the world s overall happiness   a one  time seminary student who describes himself as   a man of the cloth   without the cloth      despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a   supreme being     ellie and palmer hit it off   and even take the time to sleep together    it s a weak and hurried relationship   but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on    meanwhile   dr   david drumlin   tom skerritt     who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money   is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding    this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors   eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation   and only a one night stand to remember    it is in this nm city where   several months later   ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space   perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science    when the signal is closely examined   many new developments spring up   and before long   drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at    eventually   it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega   where the signal seems to have originated      the media swarms   fanatics go further off the deep end   scientists clamor for new information   politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take   and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality   remember when zemeckis couldn t get enough of this in forrest gump        as if that weren t enough   ellie s discovery leads her to the nation s capital where she again runs into palmer    contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs   religion    the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented   with no signs of bias    arguments for both sides are intelligent   solid   and thought provoking    when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega   of which ellie is a leading candidate     personal convictions play a more important role than love interests    the question is   can a person who doesn t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 9-1% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power    even when the film wraps up   it s uncertain whether it s meant to play as an advocate for religion   science   both   or even neither   and in our modern day society where   right and wrong   is only opinion   at least speaking   politically correctly       the ambiguity is an incentive    don t get me wrong    as much as it sounds like it   contact isn t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film    it s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours    despite its seemingly heavy issues   it s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film    the special effects are outstanding   though   warning !

 roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton    this italian film star   best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther   has done the near im1sible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust    but benigni s life is beautiful   la vita e bella   is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love   devotion and sacrifice    the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni s guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore    like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him   most notably the almost forgotten harry langdon   benigni s guido has a childlike innocence    he ignores the growing anti semitism of the fascist government    instead   guido ardently falls in love and persues dora   a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official    in benigni s tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate   yet slapstick   encounter    guido wins dora    they marry    fast forward about five years    guido   dora   and their 5 year old son   giosue     giorgio cantarini   are a happy family    guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore    but racial and anti semitic tensions are on the rise in italy   and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities    the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp    here   guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son   but to keep him from being exterminated    it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched    for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror   the pain   the unimaginable suffering of a schindler s list    true   many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over   and most were not sent to the death camps   but to work camps where they were used as slave labor    unlike steven spielberg   benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust    his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child    for guido   to save his son   transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game    giosue   must follow the rules without question to amass 1   -1-1-1 points    the winner takes home a tank    therefore   guido tells him   he must remain hidden in the barracks    he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him    guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates    guido   lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners   instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive    throughout their imprisonment   guido s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm s way    ultimately   the allies rescue the camp    in a poignant scene   giosue   comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound    the boy goes wide eyed with wonderment and delight   thinking he has won the game    the price for his victory is most high    benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell   a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness    life is beautiful is a fantasy   a fable    it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust    those who object to it are missing its point    and that is simply where there is hope   where there is life and where there is love   the spark of humanity will never be extinguished    committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  ,1
 larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi million dollar hustler publications company    the people vs   larry flynt is the story of larry flynt s fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine   hustler    based on a true story   the film is almost a documentary in that it s a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt s life    woody harrelson gives an excellent performance    he conveys flynt s peculiarities and his character with depth and focus    by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves   somewhat grudgingly   liking larry flynt    this is some feat given flynt s apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court    however   flynt has a number of things going for him   he s rich   he s funny   and most importantly   he says exactly what he means    larry flynt s wife   althea leasure is played by courtney love    larry meets althea at one of his clubs   and they fall in love   a very sexual and open love      both of them indulge in a world of too much sex   and eventually too much drugs    flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down   which was especially upsetting for him   by an assassin    althea had joined him in taking the drugs    following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs   althea does not have any such plans   nor the determination to follow them    as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick    courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea s situation   as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect    it s extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away    edward norton plays flynt s lawyer   alan isaacman    again   this is a solid performance    the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt s courtroom antics    flynt is not only childish in the courtroom   but downright rude to the judges   and lands himself in a lot of trouble   and even in a mental institution   because of it    isaacman is very easy to like   and great at proving   in quite clever ways   his points to the court    milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs   larry flynt    it is not really an exciting or thrilling film   but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story    due to larry s character it is also   at times   a very funny film    however   it is much more than that    it is about the fight for freedom of speech   anti censorship   and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy    an excellent look at flynt   his life   and his story    keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey    ,1
 virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre    since  dark city    1998     films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another    the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix    all the films released after it   have been less successful    david cronenberg s existenz   released only a couple of months after the matrix   was accepted and even appreciated   by some     but the hype was gone    and when  the thirteenth floor  aired this fall   it was completely overseen and ignored    i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying   feeling like eating the same meal over and over again    it was therefore i was less than excited   when i went out to see to  the thirteenth floor     however   i was 1itively surprised by josef rusnak s latest picture    matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality   combining the best of hollywood s action and effects with an intelligent story    existenz was a violent   gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality   ending in blood and madness     the thirteenth floor  is somewhere in between    instead of going after the crowds   the action audience   like the matrix     or aiming at the horror fans   like existenz      the thirteenth floor  presents a more intelligent plot   witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience   that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding    in a near future       on  the thirteenth floor of a classified building   a genius scientist   hannon fuller   has created a simulated world   his personal dreamworld   where every inhabitant is a complex   selflearning program that only believes it is real    right after the first testing of this world   fuller     is found murdered    douglas hall       his closest friend and business partner   immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth    a beautiful woman   gretchen mol   who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery   which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence    the first   download into simulation   is impressive    it is the creator s first visit to his world   his creation    in order to enter this virtual universe   you have to take over someone s identity   become another person    this is called conciseness transfer   and this is part of the tragedy in the film   people   wake up   in unknown places and strange things start happen    they start to doubt in their own sanity    these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their   users   and creators with their sanity and their lives    it is a frightening reality   the fact that all the people in the simulation   the program links   are living out their lives   oblivious   not knowing that they are puppets in someone s fantasy    with an appealing     blade runner     type   of detective story   this film presents the beauty and 1sibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present    our modern world is metal and glass    cold   unfriendly   impersonal    the thirties are different    colorful   beautiful   elegant   virile    this contrast demonstrates a wish for change    virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical   enchanting power that seduces you into its endless 1sibilities    to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise   to some a personal playground    a life without any consequences    for others   a way to start over and   correct   their mistakes   by living in an illusion of their past    virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes   dreams and fantasies to life    at least that s how it is all beginning    but when you re waking up from your dream   the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise    this   almost narcotic effect   soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness    some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised    what is real    what is thought    who are we    if these were answered   this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made    they are off course not answered   but 1ed in an intelligent manner    the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements   since it portrays the contrast between these computer simulated universes    kirk m   petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour   grace and color   and setting this world in op1ition to our own    an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties    there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time    a rather unusual thing about the thirteenth floor  is the almost complete lack of special effects    there are no cgi animated creatures   no bullets in slow motion    this is a more philosophical approach   reminding about the european way of filmmaking    this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians   but the more serious science fiction buffs and  dark city  fans will be pleased    this film is interesting and inspiring    it has everything existenz doesn t   but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix    and then there is a happy end which   like in  dark city    completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context    the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think   since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics   including blade runner and  dark city     with this in mind    the thirteenth floor  doesn t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now   yet this is a beautiful   elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality    ,1
 i don t know what movie the critics saw   but it wasn t this one    the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring    in my personal opinion   they couldn t be more wrong    if you were expecting airplane !  like  laughs and agatha christie intense mystery   then yes   this movie would be a disappointment    however   if you re just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time   this is one to see    honest   it is    this story is about a 4th network   wbn   taking to america s airwaves in 1939    penny henderson   mary stuart masterson     the station owner s secretary   must deal with her overbearing boss   an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment s notice   partly due to the fact that they haven t been paid in weeks    among the mayhem   she must also deal with her soon to be ex husband   roger   brian benben   who desperately wants her back    unfortunately   her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation    while trying to woo penny back   roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn    mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny   i m trying to be unbiased so i won t tell you how amazing she looked     although brian benben gets most of the screen time    along with the two leads   are several recognizable faces   including corbin bernsen   l   a    law     michael mckean   laverne & shirley   and bobcat goldthwait    the special effects are amazing   and fooled me   which some may argue isn t very difficult to do   in many scenes    although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy   it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie    overall   i gave it   or an   depending on what system you use    some comments collected from friends    ,1
 it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+   the farrelly brothers+ latest film    i knew the film would be funny  the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see    but i also knew the film would be an equal opportunity offender   attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon    i figured the film would be raunchy   maybe another lucky escapee from nc 17 hell    i may laugh   but would i feel better in the morning    i needn+t have worried    +mary+ is the sweetest   warmest   all out laugh and grossfest this side of  animal house     surprisingly   the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side   and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers    they make laughter   the toughest job for a filmmaker to do   look easy    the plot is typical    thirteen years ago   geeky ted   ben stiller   lucked out in having dazzling mary   cameron diaz   go with him to the senior prom    as luck would have it   on that very day   he was hospitalized    why   i shall not tell   but i assure you   it isn+t pretty    he hires a private investigator to find her   pat healy   matt dillon      he becomes one of the great comic villains    upon finding her   he too is lovestruck   and so pursues her   lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped    it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double crossed   and goes to get her for himself    would the geek get the girl    puh lease    the ending is pure hollywood   no surprises there    but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers   hair gel   the mentally disabled   the physically handicapped   interracial marriages   homosexuals   skin conditions   serial killers   tanning   and drugged up dogs    the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission   and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame    and yet   for all the targets that are hit   the film maintains its sweet tone    mary   playing the straight role   is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful    she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother   warren   w    earl brown  miles away from the cameraman in  scream       mary+s sunniness carries the film here  it compliments the below belt gags that come at you    cameron diaz makes her totally charming   and the audience respects her   even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window    ben stiller also fares very well   totally changing his image from his  reality bites  and  flirting with disaster  straight men to being a     how to say it       a complete loser    braces   greasy long hair   not too bright   and very very funny    dillon is exceptionally creepy   especially with his capped teeth    and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom   chris elliot     tanning addict magda   lin shaye     modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman   and mary+s sweet mom   markie 1t   where has she been   !      not everything works    chris elliot+s role   skin blemishes and all   becomes merely tasteless and boring    there+s lousy dialogue about eight minute vs   seven minute exercise tapes    and there are long stretches without much going on    but the wait is worth it    when those extraordinary sequences hit   the entire theater erupted with howls   tears    belly aches   that in some sequences carried over to the following scene    the farrelly brothers have finally done it    yes   there are some raunchy bits   but when it is all over   it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been    while tasteless   it didn+t cross any lines   at least not with me    while raunchy   it wasn+t nearly as bad as  porky+s  or  boogie nights     and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick    after the funny but sour  kingpin  left a -1ative aftertaste in my palate   comes the funniest sex farce since  a fish called wanda     approach this with an open mind   and you will reap the benefits hugely    ,1

 with stars like sigourney weaver     alien   trilogy   and academy award winner holly hunter   the piano   raising arizona   etc     together in a single hollywood production   one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot    sadly for copycat   though tightly scripted and nicely plot   is still at heart   a typical hollywood thriller    helen   weaver     after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer   darryl   harry connick jr       has developed a phobia for being outdoors   so to speak    incidentally   helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers   which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes    a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco    detective monahan   hunter   and getz   mulroney     baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer   seeks the professional help of helen   who   as expected was reluctant at first    copycat   borrows   a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases   it did work    but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability   this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also        much of the time wasted could ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama    even so   weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments        weaver being the vulnerable yet strong within character   as in aliens   and hunter being the short   tough   texan speaking cop   as in raising arizona      harry connick jr     a very good jazz singer   shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter    which comes to the moment of judgement   drum roll please            copycat is a good thriller    although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show   copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats   in anticipation of the killers next immediate move    this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts    nice movie to bring your girlfriend to          ,1
 no   it is not a bad film   in fact it is so good in achieving its pur1e   i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly    event horizon is not your run of the mill sci fi film   i m sure many who have watched this will agree with me    it is not even original in that sense   and it does borrow heavily from films like alien   hellraiser and even blade runner    the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build up that makes it wonderfully horrifying    the story brings us to the year 2-15-1   where space travel have since enormously progressed    the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental pur1e   it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it 1sible for travelling distances not reachable in a man s lifetime    the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years   it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune    a search and rescue team led by miller   fishburne   is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon    the designer of the ship   dr   weir   neill   follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship    event horizon is a sci fi horror film   much truer to the word than say   alien would ever be    while in alien   the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces   in event horizon   the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying    the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb   up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough !  i can t stand this anymore !      there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime    the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also   the acting is only at most   average by most commercial standards    even so   the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film   thanks to its well paced storytelling   disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences   which incidentally   has been quite generously removed by our censorship board      director paul anderson   who did mortal kombat   and his team of `atmosphere  creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror     this picture did not do very well in the us box office most probably for the dread factor impact it has on most audiences   people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this    although on the face of it   event horizon is mostly molded for mass entertainment   many thrills   spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus    however   the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing    my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience  of event horizon    i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us    be forewarned   this film is not for the faint hearted nor for pure entertainment    be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film !  event horizon is highly recommended     but at your own risk !  it has been a long time since good horror embraced the big screen   and event horizon is one    ,1
 capsule   earthy   experimental   difficult   shockingly frank   even for 1997 !     and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops    the first few minutes of sweet sweetback s baad asssss song   yes   i checked    that s the correct number of ss   are without dialogue   just eerie montages of sounds    a young boy   obviously malnourished   is taken in and fed up by several loving mother surrogate figures    then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation   underneath the title credits   that s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts    probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life   something we re not used to seeing on screen    this is one tough movie to swallow   no matter who you are   but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately       i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences      the plot is simple but not simpleminded    sweetback   hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man   breaks his bonds and runs like hell    along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies    or at all   for that matter   the slums   the missions   the ghetto    in other   lesser   movies   sweetback would be machine gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies   in this one   we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted    ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x     by an all white jury     as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns     and it s hardly surprising why    there s a good deal of sex in the movie   but it s handled in a way that s unsettlingly frank    a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie    in one scene   sweetback visits a friend s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there   and the other man chats him up while on the toilet    we re not used to coming this close to people in real life   let alone in the movies    especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous    the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today   but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles  hands    one scene   in which a man is interrogated by the cops   is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears   and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack    another note   ssbas is not so much anti white   that would be too easy   as anti authority   and as the movie goes on to demonstrate   authority exists in many forms    governments   churches   and even the paranoid inside of one s own mind    ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom    and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet   god knows    ,1
 a fully loaded entertainment review   website coming in july !  i didn t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family    the movie bombed at the box office   and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based    my real concern   though   was the general reputation of snl related movies translating to the big screen with less than stellar results   half baked   anyone      i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining   often hilarious yet also touching little film    it is an al franken production through and through   who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture    for those of you who don t know   al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley   who has a really annoying show on a public access station about increasing your self esteem   etc   although not a licensed therapist   stuart smalley is   as the program proudly boasts     a graduate of several 12 step programs      stuart is doing well enough with his tv show   but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles    stuart s relatives are a mess   his dad and brother   harris yulin and vincent d onofrio   respectively   are alcoholics   his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce   and his mom is in constant self denial and solves all perceived problems by baking    then   disaster strikes    stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked    he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself   and there the comedy truly picks up    franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes   but as sharply drawn   real people    although smalley s dad has always imbibed too much   stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy    also   after an accident towards the end of the movie   both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought    although filled with small   very funny scenes   stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments   especially towards the conclusion    for a lightweight comedy   it handles these scenes especially well   often better than many so called   serious dramas   of today    all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one joke bit    if you feel like renting a comedy   and you haven t seen this film   i definitely recommend you try this one out    you ll laugh       you ll  cry         it s  all there    ,1
    oh my god   i sounded just like a mother !    mrs   pascal   played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold   tells her son       didn t i sound just like a mother         you are a mother     her son marty tells her disgustedly       i know   but i still can t believe it    i look at you people and wonder   how did you ever fit in my womb      marty   you see   is a grown up twin    although his sister   who thinks she is jackie o   is certifiably insane   marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes    mother and daughter   played in a brilliant performance by parker 1ey   are both varying degrees of wacko    most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is    the daughter s fantasy of being jackie o is probably the most sane part of her being    mrs   pascal is the sort that will not let jackie o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level    she explains to marty s new fiancee   lesly   tori spelling     soon after their first meeting that jackie o was holding marty s private part when she came out of the womb    the dialog by wendy macleod   based on the play by mark waters   is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment    the script   reminiscent of a david mamet play   flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters    the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane    in this storm are two sane individuals    the fiancee is a giddy   school girl type   embarrassed by everything   a complete contrast to her rival jackie o s bitter pseudo sophistication    as the two twins  younger brother   anthony   freddie prinze jr   plays the all america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother s fiancee that night       we all have our secrets     jackie o tells her potential sister in law   and boy   does she have a few    this is a house filled with them       when lesly calls it the family s   home   to mrs   pascal    they ve never had a visitor before lesly    mrs   pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their   house        in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase     made for each other     the twin s biggest   but not their only secret   is that they ve had a long term incestuous relationship    they don t like to discuss it   although they are not particularly ashamed of it    perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy   this story never pulls its punches    jackie o tries in many ways   few subtle   to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his    in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands    marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy    the chemistry between parker 1ey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing    they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world    their ri1tes are engaging filmmaking at its best    director mark waters keeps the show s energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace    his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it    jackie o is temperamentally incapable of being nice    and being jealous   she cuts lesly down mercilessly       were you poor      jackie o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished       did you eat pies    chicken pot pies         pancakes actually   lots of pancakes     lesly replies with her usual sincerity       a donut king   so is she like the queen        jackie o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king       are we entertaining royalty      with rolfe kent s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed    will it end in a big emotional explosion   a murder   people slowly cutting each other up with words   a familial catharsis   a weather disaster or what    the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere   and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell    i ll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise    the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1   25    it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations   mature themes   violent overtones and some profanity    the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers   i   e     treat the movie as it were rated nc 17    ,1
 i don t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people   but it s something i used to wonder about when i was younger    i can t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat   but i m pretty sure andrew niccol   screenwriter for the truman show   has had the same curious thought    the truman show is about a man   jim carrey   whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public    since birth   he s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven   fla     which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign    all the people in truman burbank s life are actors   and the anonymous townfolk paid extras    people watch truman s life 24 hours a day   live   with no commercial interruptions    revenue comes instead from product placement   a staple of contemporary hollywood   with truman s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones    the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else    even if you haven t seen the truman show   you ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials   the trailer and other promotion blitzes    if anything i ve written so far is a surprise to you   then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news    either way   you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it   because otherwise you ll probably think it sucks    it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror   reciting the crucial   eat me   scene from alive   wishing his neighbors a good day   afternoon and evening   and living in domestic bliss with his wife   laura linney      but weird things start happening    a stage light comes falling out of the sky   truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father    we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child   sailing through a rainstorm    the death was staged by director christof   ed harris     who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island    similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth   not the least of them truman s best friend marlon   noah emmerich     who assures him he s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he d ever do is hurt him    as truman s trusting eyes tear over   christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else    there s even a daily behind the scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman s existence    the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama   because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions    and it all hinges on carrey   who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on    he s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura    most fundamentally   it s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person s life without the person realizing it    how they coordinate extras   hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors    the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this    sure   the most interesting tv genre of the  9-1s has been reality programming and jerry springer s popularity is through the roof   but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves    and when news shows use hidden cameras   it s done in the name of the greater good   not entertainment    but merge the two and you ve got the truman show    right now   it s implausible    i mean   the fcc won t let you say the s word on the air   do you think they d let you broadcast every detail of a man s life to the entire world without his consent    one day   though   it could happen    and   even though it would mean the end of privacy   people would eat it up    you know they would    ,1
 no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan    i m referring   specifically   to the narrative form    in the sweet hereafter   egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster    said story   of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent   british columbia   that shatters the morale of the locals   is told in a most unstraightforward manner    when the film opens   the accident has already happened   and stephens   the wonderful holm     a polite ambulance chaser   has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning    throughout   we get to meet the parents of the dead   broken souls who follow stephens like   the pied piper     passages of which are read during the film      but there is one living passenger   the paralyzed nicole   polley     whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify    we finally do see the accident   about three quarters into the film   which is a stunning visual effect    a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding   then stopping   then collapsing into a frozen lake   is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and   perhaps   ever   in a motion picture    the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane   traveling to meet his hiv 1itive runaway daughter   as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre accident    i have a problem not with the story or story structure   but with egoyan s heavy  handedness behind the camera    for the first hour or so   i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears   these are miserable   miserable people    but that s just the problem   so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while   when a lot of sadness becomes too much    also   a subplot involving incest rings untrue    perhaps it wouldn t feel so contrived if it weren t shot in such a tasteful manner    there are two characters who are father and daughter   when they first appeared i thought they were lovers    i was half right    nevertheless it s worth seeing    the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that   american films are about action   canadian films are about consequences     hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors   including crash and kissed    the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films   simply because it s not boring or   in the case of kissed   afraid of its own material   necrophilia      egoyan is a fine   fine   1tmodern storyteller   whose work is entertaining   edgy and smart   if a bit too intellectual at times    though i harped on the weightiness of the material   i was always absorbed   engrossed   and surprised by the sweet hereafter    ,1
 i know what i would do with $4   4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site   especially if i were with jacob and lou       huh      well   in any event   that is the situation hank   paxton   finds himself in    he and his dim witted brother jacob   thorton   and tubby friend lou   brent briscoe   come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck    against his better judgement   hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities    the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret   and is it worth it    a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things   clay pigeons and even fargo   and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle    oh   and its much better than any of those    sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak show horror monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture    he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do    i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course    one of the film s components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick s the thin red line    in malick s three hour bore a thon   he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story    it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass   a small bird   or a flowing body of water    sure   there were obvious metaphorical connections   but there was no subtlty to his efforts    raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters    i think most viewers may miss the comparison   but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film    and then there s billy bob thorton   who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood    if it can continute to produce people like thorton   hollywood will be ok    he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here    it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade   but is is just as complex   if not more so    jacob is slow and simple   and yet we so often see him deep in thought    i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say   or didn t know how to say   or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said    here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry    though the plot is somewhat unoriginal   it has a very appealing new twist in its characters    paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group   a far cry from chet in wierd science      perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice giving wife   but she certainly doesn t do anything ruin the picture    a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un redeeming    but at least this one has an important message   unlike so many of its counterparts    ,1
 i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater   on a sunday afternoon    when the movie was over and the audience was exiting   i didn t hear one -1ative comment   and i didn t have any to offer    simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys   simon   ian michael smith   and joe   joseph mazzello     and what destiny holds for both of them    simon is a dwarf   who was not sup1ed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart    surprisingly   he does   and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle    simon thinks god has a plan for him   a pur1e for his life   and his condition   he just doesn t know what    joe is an illegitimate child   referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard     who s mom   ashley judd   won t tell him who his father is    simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem   the people in the town don t really like him   because he isn t   natural      even his own parents don t care about him   and are disappointed they didn t have a   normal   son    he is also harassed in church by the local pastor   rev   russell   david strathairn   and simon s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks    the only person   other than joe   that really cares for simon is joe s mom   who he also looks up to as a mother    it would be just simon s luck   that he would accidentally kills joe s mom   something you are told at the beginning of the movie    joe   now motherless as well as fatherless   feels the need to find out who his real father is    with the help of ben   oliver platt     the local drama teacher and joe s mom s current boyfriend   before her death     he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way    most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny   although not all of it is    simon will also look for god s plan for him   although he loses a little faith along the way    starring in the first   and last   five minutes of the film is hollywood s newest dramatic actor   jim carrey    jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off   and then tying it up just right    this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway   and he does a commendable job    simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson   this is his first film as director   but he has written several films   including the grumpy old men series    he does an outstanding writing and directing job here   the film s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly    the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat    the cast is excellent    joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance    joseph is outstanding for someone of any age   not alone someone who just turned 15    ian michael smith   in his film debut   has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation    other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast    i loved this movie   it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year    take your whole family to see simon birch   it is a magnificent film  an american masterpiece    ,1
 the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be   in some ways    in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint   and its series sequel the return of the saint   val kilmer plays simon templar   an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others    this movie closely resembles a james bond flick    it has the classic bond symbols   a man who can do just about anything and get away with it   a woman whom the man persues   a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal    kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie   although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations    the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests    as a young boy   kilmer s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork    that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name   that of a catholic saint    he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be    this leads to a devestating mistake   which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life    kilmer s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak   played by rade serbedzija    during a press conference   he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area   avoiding guards   cameras   and many other potential obstacles    once his mission is completed and he is safely home   the fee is paid    when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $5-1 million   he decides to carry out only one more mission   then retire    dr   emma russell   portrayed by elisabeth shue   has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion    this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia   where millions are without heat and are freezing to death    the only problem is   tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people    this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal    tretiak hires him to steal the equations   small pieces of paper   from shue    one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions    they are very convincing   not only to the characters in the movie   but to us    kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue s character into getting to know him even more   which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula    when the two meet   and end up having a sensual experience   kilmer s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell   as she is falling in love with kilmer s alter ego   a traveling artist    yet   he must reach his goal of $5-1 million   which requires him to steal the energy formula   putting his feelings aside    shue s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces   the names of the catholic saints   together   something no one else is able to do    when she finds him   they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak    the saint is very action packed   with few slow points    the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments    along the course of the movie   there are even a few   although brief moments of comedy    these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer s extraneous   very convincing disguises and personalities    all in all   a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non stop action    ,1
 the thirteenth floor   the third in what i would call   the reality check movie series     is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year   the matrix and existenz    all three made you think   made you wonder what is real   what isn t   and if our world is just a huge game    the thirteenth floor doesn t reach the level of originality   creativity   and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz   but it certainly gives a great shot at it    in the matrix   we were told that the humans are simply a virus    in existenz   we learned that our life could be just a game    in the thirteenth floor   we learn that we are just electronic devices   living under another world of electronic devices    there is just one world on top of another   and everything in them are fake and electronically generated    the thirteenth floor took a huge   risky turn that i didn t expect it to take   and i m not very sure it was such a great turn to make    rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film   the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds    after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller   played by armin mueller stahl   douglas hall   played by craig bierko   a man that worked under fuller for many years   must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using   to the year 1937   which consists of computer generated characters only    the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days    all of the people involved are just characters   or are they    douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours   and killed fuller    along the way   douglas interacts with many different potential suspects   and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller   jane fuller   played wonderfully by a talented young actress   gretchen mol    the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going   and doesn t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer s interests    i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz   and i wouldn t enjoy it   but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film    unfortunately   many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content   letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened    the scenes that aren t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere   leaving you wondering     what is the point of this      sometimes it was hard to believe that this story   with terrible dialogue   some bad acting   especially from craig bierko   and scenes that go absolutely nowhere   are actually true    i know this isn t a true story or anything   but a film should be able to make you think that it is    on the plus side of acting   we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor   armin mueller stahl    in the thirteenth floor   he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances    another plus is gretchen mol s realistic performance   creating her character with depth   not just staying in the one dimensional phase    don t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor   just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile   and shuts you down like any other movie would    thrills   chills   and spills aren t what you will get in this film   but you will just get another trip to send your mind on   scrambling it until you ve had enough    the bottom line  let s hope this is the last of the   reality check   based movies for awhile    ,1
 i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding    it contains parts of bringing up baby   any hepburn/tracy film   part of the plot of war games   cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday   elevator shaft action   train action   and murder    it is cute   funny   suspenseful   a little bit     sexy   a little bit      one of the bad guys was a surprise    the pace is fast enough   there are some   action   scenes    i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick    julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together    i really identified with the julia roberts character   wishful thinking   i know !     but i do have better hair !  her hair   a very dull dark brown   has no color    she could use some highlights    they both do fine with their roles   he s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she s a hotshot   cub   reporter with the chicago globe    they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie    i like the one story focus    other actors include charles martin smith as roberts  boss   olympia dukakis as nolte s coworker   nora dunn also with the chronicle   and marsha mason as a congresswoman    basically this movie is reasonably fun    there is a serious mystery to solve   and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery    it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously    i do give successful comedy high marks    ,1

 i ve never been a member of the robin williams fan club    a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way   and i sometimes feel as though i m watching a 4-1 year old class clown    in his films   williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy feely emotion   leading to wildly uneven performances    mrs    doubtfire seemed ready made for the same problems   but instead it proves to be williams  best comic screen project yet    while it still contains some characteristic self indulgence   mrs    doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly laugh comedy served up with high energy    williams stars as daniel hillard   a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior    one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda   sally field     and she files for a divorce    unemployed   living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children   daniel decides to respond to miranda s ad for an afternoon housekeeper    he turns to his brother frank   harvey fierstein     a theatrical makeup artist   and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire   a matronly 65 year old englishwoman    daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda s flirtation with a wealthy client   pierce brosnan     to spend time with the children   and to learn something about responsible parenting   all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best    mrs   doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work   and basically it does so    the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel   and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that s instantly believable    it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film   making dustin hoffman s dorothy michaels look like milton berle    more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda 1ing as nannies from hell   it s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn t recognize any of the voices as her husband s    perhaps the biggest contrivance we re asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs   doubtfire in a few minutes    there s more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask    fortunately   these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll    during the film   i was generally too busy laughing    after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams  riffing   mrs    doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place    daniel s frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful   as is the climactic restaurant sequence   even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away    clearly   most of the credit for doubtfire s success goes to robin williams    it took putting him in drag   but for once he plays a comic character that isn t just robin williams with a different name    he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire   and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul mouthed    wisely   he never aims for saintly    his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty   but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity    it s one of mrs    doubtfire s charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect   just people trying to be better    as miranda   sally field is solid in a background role   and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu    the children are also good   although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest    the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing    it s easy to see mrs    doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over   and it s true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common    but mrs    doubtfire manages to carve out its own space   particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge s decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda s relationship    there s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs    doubtfire   but there are plenty of laughs   and good comedies are always in short supply    and it s nice to see robin williams just act for a change    ,1
 weir is well respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject matter into deceptively simple   powerful films   the mosquito coast   utopia   and fearless   1t traumatic stress disorder   among them    in the truman show   weir essentially breathes life into the now tired concept of media manipulation by tackling the material from the inside out    it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top form playing the title character   truman burbank    by now you must be aware of the premise   unbeknownst to him   truman   carrey   is the star of his own tv series   a 24 7 peep show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations   people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants    `seahaven    his hometown   and the show itself   are the brainchild of christof   harris     who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon   directing over 5-1-1 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras    for 3-1 years   truman suspects nothing `we accept the reality we re given     1es christof but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji    mcelhone   who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement   overwhelms him    thus   christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact   lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly rated program    in a few broad strokes   weir creates a convincing second reality   and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three quarters through    this allows us to comprehend and accept truman s world before we contextualize it    for all his madness   christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship   and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it    truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be   well   so darn nice   like a sibling   or   perhaps more appropriately   a caged animal in an interactive zoo     they want to see him succeed    the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey he really is an everyman here   abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible   wide eyed bewilderment    cinematically   the truman show is impeccable   stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images    as well   it employs wojciech kilar s piece   zycie za zycie  masterfully and beautifully    if the film has any flaws   one may find them in laura linney s characterization as meryl   truman s   wife     i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone     and in a subplot involving truman s `father    which feels curiously incomplete    there are a few stupendous sequences   and the film pulls off a wonderful trick   we become truman s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film    they wear buttons asking `how will it end      i couldn t wait to know myself   though i didn t exactly want it to end   for this inspired movie is 1sibly the best and most complex summer picture in years    ,1
 synopsis   it s 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york    disco music is popular   and the sexual revolution is on   but the people of new york are not happy    in fact   they re terrified    as in spike lee s do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip   and peoples  tempers are flaring    the cool of night offers no respite   the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam    no one knows who the son of sam is   and no one is safe    all around new york people are different    aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals    in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny   john leguizamo   tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna   mira sorvino      vinny s friend ritchie   adrien brody   hates disco   works at a gay strip club and doesn t want any of the neighborhood folks to know    ritchie s girl ruby   jennifer es1ito   is trying to escape a reputation as a slut    everyone s different   but nobody in the film wants to be framed as   alien   to the community    unfortunately   the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor    opinion   director spike lee s summer of sam is not about a psycho killer    nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him    it s about differences and how   given the right conditions   even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion    one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex    in other movies sex is glamorized    for example   james bond gets a sexual reward for winning    or boring made for video   suspense   movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake    and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess    not so with summer of sam    in a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy    sex is there   but it isn t gratuitous or titillating    in fact   some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed    sex is in the film because   sexual   deviance is part of the film s major theme of   difference   breeding hostility    in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999   as rare and thought provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking    ,1
 part one of   the strangest movies ever made   series at www   mediajunkies   com  by scott watson  [light spoilers   nothing you shouldn t read]  existenz has been called   a gooey matrix     and while this is a correct description in some ways   in others it is completely off    the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal     real   reality    a major difference is that   the matrix   has a base reality that is obviously the true reality   while existenz does the im1sible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true    and oh what a reality it is    david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies   naked lunch   crash     but this one is one of the strangest    maybe it s because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre    technology is organic   but only some of it    cars are normal    gas stations are the same    cell phones are glowing bug like appendages    you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus   referred to simply as a   pod        high technology has been replaced with organic creatures   and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters    a famous game designer   allegra geller   a fine looking jennifer jason leigh     flees a demonstration of her latest game   existenz   after an assassination attempt    she is on the run   from who   i m still not sure     and has to save her pod by playing her game with   someone friendly      that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard   ted pikul   jude law      unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing   a bioport    sort of a hole in your spine   ok   exactly like a hole in your spine     a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail looking wires from the pod into you   allowing you to play the game    luckily a bioport can be installed easily   they install them in malls     so off they go to get one    after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station   they are able to plug in and play existenz    the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies   reality distortion   chinese restaurants   and multi appendaged amphibian things     it s a sign of the times        but the plot   while cohesive in it s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe    cronenberg just slaps this weird organic tech world into the viewers lap   and it s up to you to figure out how all these things work    and that s the true joy of this film   entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place    you learn a little bit piece by piece   oh   they make pods out of those     and it s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you    there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around   including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards    also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz   the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover    there s lots of little things that set off the weird o meter   like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store   the two headed amphibian creature   and why that guy at the gas station s name appears to be   gas      it all adds up to a supremely far out trip   and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix s virtual world        oh wait   i already do    ,1
 good films are hard to find these days    great films are beyond rare    proof of life   russell crowe s one two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller   is one of those rare gems    a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting   an intelligent script   and masterful directing   together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days   genuine motivation in a story that rings true    consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan s character in the film    all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world    i haven t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah s masterpiece   the getaway    but enough with the gossip   let s get to the review    the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman   david morse     an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti government soldiers    upon discovering his identity   the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million    the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off   and no one will step forward with the money    with no choice available to her   bowman s wife alice   ryan   hires terry thorne   crowe     a highly skilled -1otiator and rescue operative   to arrange the return of her husband    but when things go wrong    as they always do in these situations    terry and his team   which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year   david caruso   take matters into their own hands    the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character driven vehicle filled with well written dialogue   shades of motivation   and convincing acting by all the actors    the script is based on both a book   the long march to freedom   and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations   and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy   screenwriter of the devil s advocate and dolores claiborne    the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan   but that between crowe and david caruso    dug out from b movie hell   caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe s right hand gun while providing most of the film s humor    ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes   david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him   and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic   gunslinger character of terry thorne    the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes    the bulk of those scenes   which bookend the movie   work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story s characters    the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise    director taylor hackford mixes both his old school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film    proof of life is a thinking man s action movie    it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war   and the sacrifices one makes for those choices    the sacrifices that help you sleep at night    ,1
 i must admit i m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity   because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend    the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity    i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre   but something drew me to this film    maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role   and the hilarious eugene levy    maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity   con air   and pushing tin    but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life    the story of serendipity is simple    two people   john trager   john cusack   and sara thomas   kate beckinsale   looking ever so hot     have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves    with buck henry smack dab in the middle    charmed beyond repair   these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf   called serendipity   talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down   and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink    but with each of them already involved with other parties   sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera    sara declares that if this   thing      let s just call it love    is destined to happen   fate will bring them together in the future    years later and on op1ite coasts of america   john and sara    both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates    decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts    what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat and mouse game with the fates   involving such items as mistaken identity   a graduate homage   john corbett as a freaky new age musician   and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman    to find out if that   thing   was right after all    fortunately   first time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong   well rounded   characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative    coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom   director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones   and the use of time lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years    the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity    both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters  on the flipside   films such as you ve got mail   made in heaven   and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film s main journey at hand    but it s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture    ,1
 in some regards   making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it    try too hard   and it snaps   but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther    in simon birch   director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique   he takes advantage of caution and poise   but also risks his movie with a few bold steps    in the end   he s not only holding an unbroken band   but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature    there s no doubt about it   the film that johnson has crafted is rich    he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown   maine   leaves turn bright orange in the fall   the grass is a lush green   pure white snow falls in the winter   and the sky goes on forever    the characters continue that turn   our two leads are simon birch   ian michael smith   and joe wenteworth   joseph mazzello      simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital   and by age twelve he s only two feet tall    joe is the bastard son of rebecca   ashley judd     and by age twelve he s ready to know who is father is    naturally   the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together   from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball    in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith   simon birch is convinced that he s god s instrument   and there must be a reason he s so small    joe doesn t quite buy it   but he sticks by simon   the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other s only true friends    early on   the two meet up with ben goodrich   oliver platt     rebecca s new boyfriend   and although the bond isn t immediate   ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other    both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability    the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon   a testament to the acting jobs of both    finally   jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day   and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show    mark steven johnson s sense of drama and writing is fantastic    the script is loosely based on john irving s novel   a prayer for owen meany   but it s so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from  based on  to  suggested by      along those same lines   it s almost unfitting to compare the two   johnson uses tension   humor   atmosphere   and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions    by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity   gump made over 3-1-1 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks   but the winning idea remains the same    simon birch is a different look at a different life   and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come    in the present   however   it s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at    ,1
 on the basis of this film alone   i never would have predicted that   in two years   quentin tarantino would become the country s biggest hotshot director    reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction   but is a much less substantive   more conventional crime story than the big pf    here s what the two movies do have in common          scenes of intelligent   amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot   a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical   chronological sequence   graphic yet necessary violence   an engaging crime story   dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs   three of the same actors   harvey keitel   tim roth and steve buscemi     a mexican standoff ending   although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf  reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it s only got one story to tell rather than three    crime lord joe cabot   veteran actor lawrence tierney   has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist    the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated    instead   they are all given code names off the color chart    mr   white   keitel     mr   pink   buscemi     mr   orange   roth     mr   blonde   michael madsen     mr   brown   tarantino   and mr   peach   tarantino s chin      most of the movie s running time is spent with mr   white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive    mr   orange   meanwhile   is on the floor   dying from a gunshot wound    the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon   leading white to believe one of the five was an informant    the story s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks   of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime    eventually   blonde arrives with a police officer hostage   and what follows is a truly brutal   uncomfortable torture scene    let s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop s ear    a lot of the time   reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist gone wrong movie   but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino    the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn t live up to   as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on   among other things   tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna s   like a virgin      another scene involves roth s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana    neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop   like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction   only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie    reservoir dogs is good but it s no pulp fiction    ,1
 it s a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn t need violence to be good or worth watching    all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails    and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo nuclear war    and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon    a computer whiz kid   david   is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades    but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game   he wants to be the first to play it    instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad    with the help of jennifer   a girl in his biology class   he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr   war operation plan response   a top notch computer at the time   but now hardly faster than my own computer    i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema    it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn t changed    of course   a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983    i wouldn t be surprised if this gave people nightmares    i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon    broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers   although her interest in david remains a mystery      but the rest of the actors are   by no fault of their own   restricted by the script to play one dimensional grownups    david s parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 198-1s   movies like secret admirer   porky s or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr   strangelove    if for no other reason   you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days    david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers    the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on    far from any 56k modem my guess is that it s some kind of 24-1-1 bps modem   the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum    the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights   just like those you see on star trek or any old sf movie   but it s hardly impressing compared with what you can get today    what are the lessons we can learn from wargames    1    make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers    2   thank you   whoever it was   for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers !  ,1
 there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie    action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences   while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full circle    for fans of both genres   however   realism is key    action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic   and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie s end    on this advice   director john frankenheimer   the island of dr    moreau   strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller   ronin    the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing   considering the fare that s fallen into the same category over the last few years    the script   written by j   d   zeik in his big screen debut   approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission   im1sible two years ago    a certain number of people will be lost by this   but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times    frankenheimer masters the script with poise   and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of 1t cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck    his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here   and ronin becomes a better movie because of it    robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time    he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex spy sam   a man who s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre   natascha mcelhone   recover a package    the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast   especially once the requisite double crossing begins   and its role is skillfully penned by zeik    at times   however   zeik s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission   im1sible   de niro might easily become tom cruise   the package might become cruise s computer disk    fortunately   the focus here is almost entirely on the package   whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double cross and why it happened    the action content is impressive   and it lives up to the hints given in previews    the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness    ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish   but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots    the suspense tapers off considerably by the end   a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie s open    considering these factors it s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well   and it s another good bet this month    since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months   it s definitely worth the visit    ,1
 jay and silent bob strike back   kevin smith s swan song to his two most famous characters   is the best received comedy that i ve seen since there s something about mary   which is a tea party in comparison to the foul mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back    the audience didn t just laugh   they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout    in short   if you like really raunchy humor   you may find it   as i did   to be the funniest movie of the year       on the other hand   if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith s dogma   then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you      in one of the fastest paced movies of the year   the story has jay and silent bob   jason mewes and kevin smith     a pair of card carrying drug dealers   traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie    it seems their comic book alter egos   bluntman and chronic   are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob s consent    jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it    jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i ve ever seen    among others   they include carrie fisher as a bible toting nun   mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell     action !    best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies    the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was   stupid   enough to buy tickets to this movie       actually   purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory      the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet    guilty    although it s filled with inside jokes   you ll still be laughing even if you only get some of them    it s easy to understand enough so that they are still funny    jay is a motor mouth who hasn t met a subject that he couldn t vulgarize    his favorite topic is oral sex   but   being an equal opportunity profaner   he s willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything    but it is his buddy   the aptly named silent bob   who is responsible for most of the movie s success    his reaction shots   with his wildly exaggerated eye movements   are comedic gems    the story s main subplot concerns four animal rights activists   justice   shannon elizabeth   and her three sexy buddies   sissy   eliza dushku     missy   jennifer schwalbach smith   and chrissy   ali larter      these charlie s angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture    jay tries to put the moves on justice   but he doesn t stay in command of the situation for long    one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink   clam shaped   birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry    granted   it s not the movie for everyone   but   if you like kevin smith s brand of humor   you ll find that this is his best    and   as i said earlier   it s the funniest movie of the year thus far    no   wait    forget   `thus far      it s bound to be the funniest movie of the year    in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg 13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash   it s great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience    jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1   35    it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations    it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older    the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday   august 22   2-1-11    in the silicon valley   it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters    ,1
 damn those trailers    had it not been for the advertising of this film   which reveals far too much about its contents   i would have been glued to `under the sand     as it is   the film retains some value   thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling   and a more mature francois ozon in the director s chair    marie   charlotte rampling   and her husband jean   bruno cremer   lounge on the beach    she takes a nap while he goes for a swim    when marie wakes up   jean is nowhere to be found    she contacts authorities   but they can t find him either    did he disappear to start a new life    was he killed by accident    did he commit suicide    marie still asks herself these questions a year later   and in order to move on with her life   she must find some answers    it s a fine premise   and this little movie uses it to the limit    the film moves at a leisurely pace   a bit slow   but relaxing    it s a very visual story   and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles    this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie   who shot the film in a dreamy haze   and the lead performance by rampling    rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie   you connect with her character instantly   despite that she s delusional    the scenes where she interacts with her husband   who she still believes is alive   are heartbreaking    she can t quite get over him    they ve been married for twenty five years    the other actors   particularly jacques nolot   are excellent too    the sex in the film is rather unneeded   but compared to ozon s `criminal lovers    it s the disney channel    likely to cause some discussion afterwards   `under the sand  is a fine movie going experience    while it s hard to recommend as entertainment   it s a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss    ozon seems to ask what you would do   and that s certainly a hard question to answer    ,1
 bob the happy bastard s quickie review    rush hour  so what s the problem with 48 hours clones these days    they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had    that was the problem that plagued these clones   not to mention the actual sequel   another 48 hours   a complete waste of film    but   at last   someone has a different take on the matter   and it s director brett rainer    rush hour features jackie chan in his first u   s   action movie   playing a chinese detective who s being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate s daughter    of course   the fbi is upset that he ll be interfering in their investigation   and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth  of course   that s chris tucker    what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker    tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity     i m michael jackson   you tito         and chan delivers a few zingers of his own   as well as some terrific fight scenes    the story s pretty much your average fare   but with a decent twist involving the main villain   a highly clouded figure named jun tao    at least it s entertaining   and the concept is excellently realized    a particular fight scene in a chinese office   where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys   is funny and energetic at the same time    and the finale s a real treat as well       chan  delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 1-1 story drop    rush hour is just the sort of film you ll get a kick out of on any night of the week    just make sure you don t look for anything culturally different and you ll be fine  drunken master ii this ain t    ,1
 according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers   isolated motels   diners   gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers    at the beginning of eye of the storm   1991 german  american thriller directed by yuri zeltser   one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up    ten years later their son steven   played by bradley gregg     who was blinded during the incident   still runs motel together with his older brother ray   played by craig sheffer      hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone   played by dennis hopper   gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra   played by lara flynn boyle      their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed    yuri zeltser   author of this film   was obviously inspired by hitchcock s psycho   but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot    instead of norman bates we have two brothers   one of them traumatised physically   another mentally    sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband    eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense   with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere    the acting is fine   hopper   gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles   but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine    unfortunately   eye of the storm   which was sup1ed to be intense psychological drama   deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale    in the end   this film reminds us that original approach can t prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities       special note to the profiler fans   ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer s girlfriend      ,-1
 if you ve been following william fichtner s career   and there s absolutely no reason why you should have     you might have noticed that he s played some rather similar roles over the years    like sully in   the perfect storm     tough   gruff   and a little bit scary    or law in   albino alligator     tough   gruff   and little bit scarier    or colonel william sharp in   armageddon     or dwayne engelman in   strange days     or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of   pearl harbor     as the abusive father of danny  here is an actor who gravitates towards tough   gruff   hard hitting roles    which is why his performance in   what s the worst that could happen      is such a shock   such a delight    in the film   fichtner plays a blonde haired   meticulously dressed   overtly effeminate   dog loving detective    as alex tardio   fichtner s performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it    it borders on offensive but doesn t really manage it    and it borders on clich   d stereotype but doesn t quite succumb to that definition either    in a role so diametrically op1ed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming   fichtner isn t perfect  you can see him struggling a little at times   concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air   or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal  but he s pretty damned good   and silly   and without question the best thing in the film    in fact   had it not been for fitchner s sudden and bizarre appearance   and his jarring screen presence thereafter   i would have walked out   for   what s the worst that could happen      is mesmerizing in its awfulness   a poorly written   haphazardly edited   and totally unfunny   yes   it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be 1sible      moviegoing experience    fichtner s performance doesn t exactly save the film   and it s not like i m recommending   what s the worst that could happen      solely on the strength of the actor s dramatic turnaround   but his contributions do raise the film s rating from no stars to one and a half    thumbs up to fichtner then   and thumbs down  way   way   down  to everyone else involved in this sorry mess   a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn t even warrant discussion    ,-1
 note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    it s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor s first feature film   dream with the fishes   when the plodding   tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup    any hopeful expectations   however   are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film s latter half    the film s central characters are terry   david arquette     a depressed   lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident   and nick   brad hunt     a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill    nick lives in the apartment building across from terry   who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz   kathryn erbe   with his trusty set of binoculars   but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge   unconvincingly vowing suicide    nick casually asks for terry s wristwatch   and eventually cons terry into a trade   the watch for a bottle of pills    of course   terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects   and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch    learning of nick s condition   he only has a handful of weeks left     terry s compassion kicks in   and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement   terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick s lifelong fantasies   and nick will fulfill terry s death wish by killing him    this is a promising premise   and mr   taylor s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point   but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters   terry is a repessed   mournful character who wants to die   while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live   and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits   and where the straight laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character    this is by the numbers plotting   buddy movie/road movie redux    however   dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline   but by the characters which carry the story   it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic   if not likeable    unfortunately   that is not the case here   where both of the film s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying   giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights   and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits    far from a romp   this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt   and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond    mr   taylor s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes   while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone   it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived   witness such lines as   you should have asked something more interesting   like  do you enjoy the pain        see   that s provocative   leaves room for further questions        the film enjoys a few inspired moments   the urn scene   a session of nude bowling   the policeman joining in on terry and nick s acid trip   but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between   and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes    this occurs particularly often during the film s opening sequence   as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital   i m realising that this is * intended * to be funny   although nary a smile crept upon my lips   which is probably due to the obvious fact that it s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts   sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick s scheme of tricking him   this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes    the entire sequence is   then   clearly an exercise for character ex1ition   with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability    among the cast   coming off best is david arquette   the current master in the portrayal of meek   squirming   stammering fresh faced characters   he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang s swimming with sharks   who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry    mr   taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique   where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated   as op1ed to a bright   crisp look for the smalltown scenes    the charge of dream with the fishes s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me   i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters   and indeed   in many cases have i been in the minority   supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult   audience unfriendly nature of their characters    for dream with the fishes   though   i did find myself on the flip side of coin   often hoping that the film would quickly conclude   and that the nick character would just hurry up and die    ,-1
 for his directoral debut   gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent   alcoholic husband and father   and the various lives he affects    but while the characters   places and events may have special meaning to the writer director   the audience is left in the dark    the center of this tale is the abusive raymond   ray winstone     and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him    he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars    then   he returns home to his pregnant wife   valerie   kathy burke   and their five year old daughter    raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies   and his paranoid delusions   early on when he accuses valerie s brother   billy   charlie creed miles     of stealing    raymond then proceed to beat   and bite   him to a bloody wreck    but these are the least of billy s problems    billy is a heroin addict on the downturn   and it doesn t seem that he ll last much longer    billy and valerie s mother   janet   laila morse     is raymond s nemesis    she disapproves of him   and he of her     but is powerless to do anything about it    she merely struggles on   hoping her children will survive their respective torments    if this description seems bleak   i haven t told the half of it    this is not a cheery movie   and most of the time it s downright depressing    while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick   and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him   in the end   it s not quite worth it    there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no pur1e    take for example the extended sequence where one of billy s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy    the film is filled with these   character moments   that never really achieve anything    granted   there are a few genuinely powerful   and sickening   moments in the film   but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us    the actors do a fine job   particularly in the central roles    the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes   and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into    the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices    a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience    oldman got it about half right    ,-1
 my first ex1ure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one   but in fact the third installment   it was the first to gain a national theatrical release      i didn t see the first film until much later    so looking back   the original didn t hold a lot of great memories for me   since i didn t think too much of it when i initially saw it    watching it now for a second time confirmed that it s an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever    you all know the story by now   child murderer freddy krueger   robert englund   returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before    this first installment does an adequate job with it s low budget   but there s some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story    plus the movie s ending   understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a   hook   for a sequel   renders the rest of the film pointless    and does anyone understand what happens to nancy s mother at the end of this film    don t get me wrong though        it s not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics    most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is    horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly   and a nightmare on elm street just doesn t cut it    a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video    it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set    the film is presented in both pan and scan and it s original theatrical aspect ratio of 1   78   1   although on the disc that comes in the box set   only a widescreen transfer is provided      the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio   a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5   1 mix    also included on the dvd is a full length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven   stars john saxon and heather langenkamp   and the film s director of photography    other extras include the   jump to a nightmare   feature   i m sure you can figure that one out     the usual cast and crew bios   which are from the film s original press release kit   and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp !     and the film s original theatrical trailer    some dvd rom features are also included   but since i don t have dvd rom capabilities i can t really get into that    the commentary track is entertaining and informative   but nothing spectacular    the first thing of note is that it s the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago    i m not saying that s a -1ative thing   just pointing it out    everyone seems enthusiastic about being there   with the 1sible exception of john saxon   who just doesn t say much at all    most of the time you ll forget he s even there    everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason   as if because they re commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as 1sible    the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series    also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film        however you can only access one easily    the other is hidden in what s called   the labyrinth     which might 1sibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created    basically   it s an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage   interviews   etc   somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film    finding it though is both a chore and a bore    [r]  ,-1
 in 1989   tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather    was it   deep      nope    however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up    it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was   without the comic book uplift   of the indiana jones and superman pictures    which was true    if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man s escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place    if those films were tom sawyer   then batman was huckleberry finn    some critics   glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone   realized that it was something special   mr   lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that   this is batman as batman should be        mr   travers called it one of the ten best films of the year    the praise was deserved   from start to finish the film was enthralling   exciting   and superb in every respect    there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton    the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes    the villains   the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman   take over   and our epectations are always left unfulfilled   when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman s nose he simply gets mad   and when we want catwoman to slither over batman s body she gets pushed off a building    i admire mr   burton for trying to do more then entertain   but the result is a mess    nothing works out as planned   it fails both to entertain and to enlighten    hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast    alas   these are only hints    there are   don t misunderstand me   several moments of cinematic genuis contained   catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said   christopher lloyd is trapped   by the penguin   within a giant cage   a small basket is dropped into a large river   but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis    a weak followup   both career and sequel wise   batman returns is sometimes dazzling   but to often dissapointing    ,-1
 and i thought   stigmata   would be the worst religiously oriented thriller released this year    turns out i was wrong   because while   stigmata   was merely boring and self important     end of days   is completely inept on all fronts    it s a silly   incomprehensible   endlessly stupid mess    for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarze-1ger at his best   it s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up    for the first time in recent memory   an arnold action movie   and   batman & robin   doesn t count   is no fun at all       end of days   is a major stinker    the movie opens in vatican city   1979    some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy   which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation    if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31   1999   the world will be destroyed    the pope orders protection of this girl   though some priests believe she ought to be killed    in new york   that very night   a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy    twenty years later   we meet jericho cane   schwarze-1ger     a suicidal ex cop with a drinking problem    now working as a security guard for hire   he is protecting a local businessman   gabriel byrne     who is actually 1sessed by the devil    an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after   christine york   robin tunney      recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine   including ownership of the same music box   apparently     jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her    there are so many problems with this film it s hard to know where to begin   but how about starting with the concept    casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with    schwarze-1ger is a persona   not an actor   so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea    arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions    in other words   trying to give him dimension was a mistake    harrison ford   mel gibson   or even bruce willis could have played this role   they ve all played noble and flawed heroes     but not schwarze-1ger    there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho s character   one has him contemplating suicide   another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter   and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine s location by offering him his old life back    none of these scenes really work   because arnie isn t up to the task    the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong   confident character   like the terminator   for example     the likes of which schwarze-1ger has excelled in before    this one isn t at all believable the way arnold plays him    the supporting cast tries their hardest   and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all    as the prince of darkness   he s suave and confident    he acts like one would expect the devil to act    the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense   more on that later   and that undermines him as a powerful villain    byrne out performs arnold in every scene they have together   including the aforementioned temptation bit     but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable   root for the devil    byrne s speech about the bible being   overrated   actually starts to make sense   mainly because arnold s attempts at refuting it   mostly of the    tis not !    variety   are feeble at best    the only problem is   arnold has to win   so in the end   nobody really cares    kevin pollack plays jericho s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides   but like most bad action movie sidekicks   he disappears after about an hour    robin tunney isn t given much to do except look scared    in fact   all of the supporting players are good actors   but none   save for byrne   is given anything interesting to do    performances aside   it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it    this being an action blockbuster   it s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script   which starts off totally confusing   and when some of it is explained   and not much of it is     it s utterly ridiculous    why is the devil coming on new year s eve   1999    because it s exactly 1-1-1-1 years after the year of the devil   which isn t 666   it turns out    some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down   so the real year is 999   so just add a 1 to the beginning   and you ve got 1999 !  if you don t buy this explanation   you re not alone    it s convoluted and silly at the same time    the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous   she s christine   see   and she lives in new york   see               and if that weren t bad enough   there s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn t explained at all    why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street   but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex cop   he s powerless    is he impervious to only one kind of bullet    how come he can t control jericho or christine    and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies    a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this   but it s never actually explained    usually   this sort of thing wouldn t matter in a schwarze-1ger flick   i mean   don t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies     but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting    there are several predictable horror film clich   s present in   end of days     complete with the old   black cat hiding in a cabinet   bit   not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there    it gets so formulaic that it s 1sible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a   boo   will come    their predictions will rarely be wrong    the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless   partially because we don t care about these characters   due to the script s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup     and also because they   too   don t make any sense    there s a scene where schwarze-1ger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady    it s good for a few chuckles   but not much else    sup1edly we re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan   but the script never sets that up   so the scene is merely silly    none of this is terribly exciting   because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it s often hard to tell why it s happening in the first place   not to mention that they re edited in full on incomprehensible mtv quick cut style    most of them had me scratching my head   rather than saying     wow   cool !       end of days   is not only silly and confusing   but it s also distinctly unpleasant to watch    the devil apparently doesn t operate in the more subtle   i ll convince people to kill each other fashion outlined in the bible   but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight    this doesn t only make him an awfully predictable sort   but it also means that not a single scene in   end of days   goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence   or the odd kinky sexual encounter   yet another bit that had me scratching my head      if violence is sup1ed to be shocking   it s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb    scenes aren t connected through any reasonable means   so a lot of the time   stuff gets blown up   or people get killed   and i had no idea why    reasons    to hell with reasons !  let s just blow stuff up !  isn t it cool    nope   not by a long shot    this film is thoroughly unwatchable    it s dull   interminable   and unrelenting in its stupidity    perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career   because it s not happening with hack peter hyams here       end of days   might have had camp value   if only it didn t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody s going to buy    if the movie is going to be serious   the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script    if it s going to be campy   arnold shouldn t be taking himself so damn seriously   i didn t actually see him put up on a cross   did i       and his character shouldn t be such a sad sack    as it stands     end of days   is just a bad movie   and an awfully gloomy one at that    ,-1
 stephen   please 1t if appropriate       mafia !     crime isn t a funny business by homer yen   c   1998  on a particular night when i found myself having some free time   i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see   mafia !     a spoof of mafia and crime films such as   the godfather       goodfellas   and   casino      at 84 minutes in length   i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep    but by my account   i think that my laff o meter only registered a few grins   one giggle   and maybe one chortle    i sup1e that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star   lloyd bridges   who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film       mafia !    chronicles vincenzo cortino s   lloyd bridges   life    separated from his family when he was young   he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life    but as fate would have it   vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord    following in his footsteps are his two sons   joey   billy burke   and anthony   jay mohr      like all siblings in powerful crime families   they squabble over power   the future of the family   fortune   and women       mafia !   is co written by jim abrahams   who also contributed to some gut busting funny spoofs such as   airplane   and   the naked gun      but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work    as i write this   i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based    crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence    it s a tough genre to parody    i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies   maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say   please   as they decide which sector to take over   but this opportunity was never explored    there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter in law    a gunman shoots him several times    the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him   from the samba to disco to the macarena    i think that i just gave away the best part of the film    oh well   that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier    ,-1
 die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco   inferior to the original in every respect    place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson   who wrote the film s pathetic screenplay    every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor    the plot is altogether implausible   the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower   leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land    the film has zero credibility   and all of the characters come off as cliched   cardboard cut outs    so much for the script    how about the action    well   let s put it this way   director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan   who directed the original   as well as the hunt for red october and predator  all standouts for their hair raising suspense    by contrast   harlin doesn t have a clue when it comes to choreographing action   and consequently   die hard 2 never picks up steam    die harder is im1sible to take seriously even for a minute    in fact   the movie often seems deliberately campy   and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it s good    you do laugh   but you laugh at the film   not with it    die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff    ,-1
 i admit it    i thought arnold schwarze-1ger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies    watching him in jingle all the way   i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids    it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg 13 kindergarten cop   but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence   alcohol consumption   burglary   racism and child molestation    and you know they ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa s elves    he later decks a reindeer    hey   man   why don t you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you re at it    jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass   it must be funny school of thought    arnold   sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team   and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene    what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can t find a rare toy on christmas eve   and will do anything to get one    arnold is   of course   one of the parents   a crack salesman who is never there for his son    he races from the office to his son s karate game   only to find out he missed it    and his kid distrusts him because he s never around       gee   we haven t seen that in a movie before      arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son s affection is to get him a turboman doll   which his wife   rita wilson   who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this   told him to get weeks ago    so arnold sets out to find a turboman   which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out    let me back up for a minute here    arnold s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character   which is unhealthy beyond belief    watches the show   eats the cereal   sleeps on the freakin  turboman sheets    i d try to discourage any further obsession myself   lest any kid seeing this movie think it s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want    but nooooo   the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade   exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son   who don t recognize him until the last minute    this is a sad movie all the way through   but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store   racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa   jim belushi   who runs a bootleg toy factory    most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station   where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay   an embarrassed martin mull   who said he was giving away a turboman doll    capitalism has produced some pretty evil things   chia pets     but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful    never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping     your cookies are incredible       it s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it s okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want    maybe that s what christmas is like at the schwarze-1ger house   but not at mine    ,-1
 when the haunting arrived in theaters   all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects    while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department   i don t think that they are completely to blame for this movie s failure    it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the   unseen   terrors   and it was about as scary as a dust bunny    so special effects or not   if the story isn t the least bit scary   you aren t going to end up with a very frightening movie    the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern    dern is always great   and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie    as i sat through the seemingly endless   albeit fairly impressive   special effects   i kept wishing that this movie was about dern s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast    never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie    liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear    he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion    he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia    and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings on    catherine zeta jones   lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects    like the original   taylor s character is the star of the movie    but since she doesn t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms   zeta jones   their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original    and let s face it   probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta jones    i ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren t in it    but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets    they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients    there really isn t much of a story here    just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with    and the special effects are great    in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere    in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the   cool shots   quota    at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary    funny   maybe    but not scary    then we have the set    when i first saw the house   i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it    but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did   and decided to take the idiotically overdone route    this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves    what part did these rooms play in the story    absolutely none    they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie    then we have the actors    lili taylor has never been one of my favorites    and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in   she comes in around the average or slightly below mark    i have no idea why liam neeson took this role    he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus    his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him    i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman    zeta jones was cast because she is too hot for words    the fact that her character is bi sexual is just icing on the cake    all catherine has to do in this movie is look good    fortunately that is something she does very well    while she does have a fairly good size part   it is obvious that her only pur1e in the movie was as eye candy    it s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here    any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role    the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999 s horror movies   the blair witch project    the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget   while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares    both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film    if the story sucks   it s all downhill from there    my advice    if you are looking for special effects   go rent star wars    if it s scares you want   rent halloween    either way   it s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting    ,-1
 plot   set in the future   a courier has uploaded some data into a   hard drive   that resides in his head   and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information    since he overloaded his   hard drive     he s also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him    critique   incoherent   boring   one act drivel with no suspense   horribly unbelievable futuristic environment   bad dialogue   career defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending    it s too bad because the premise of the film was interesting   but unfortunately for my friends and i   this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us    it s one of those films that makes you start laughing half way through   when you realize that most of the actors in it suck   the location shots are filmed in dark   junkyard   type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic   whatever           and all the sets look like         well    sets    there is also absolutely no arc to this story    it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain   and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings    gibson should stick to writing novels and   x files   episodes   since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage    some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose sup1ed to kick ass   henry rollins as a pumped up cyber doctor or something   and ice t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face   don t ask      the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point    i m ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal   canada   but sadly enough for us all   it was    some of the cyber travelling special effects were okay   hence   the 2/1-1     but overall   it s one of those bad movies that s just funny to watch and cringe at    thankfully for keanu   he redeemed his sci fi career with 1999 s the matrix   7   5/1-1      it s too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent    little known facts about this film and its stars   as of 1999   director robert longo never directed another full feature film    hmmm       now  isn t that odd         writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968   after being rejected for the draft    he lived in toronto at first   but since 1972   has made vancouver his home    his 1984 novel   neuromancer   and its sequels 1986 s   count zero   and 1988 s   mona lisa overdrive   are generally considered to be the definitive works of the   cyberpunk   science fiction sub genre    this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the   worst actor   category in the 1996 razzie awards    ,-1
 i am a steven seagal fan    i only say this now because   mufti splenetik   isn t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things    any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on    seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue   heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones   which we ll always hear when seagal does his limb twisting thing     rarely a female co lead in sight   unless it s a real life model wife who hasn t worked since weird science   and   usually the worst 1sible titles you can imagine    not to mention very straightforward plots   generally all round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather face himself in that same black outfit he s been in since nico doing his   my hands are sharp   nimble knives   thing   seagal the stoic   sir petrified ponytail   duke of dull    in the glimmer man   seagal breaks out of this formula   he gets a * sidekick *   attempts to banter   and puts on a new vest    he s also put on quite a lot of weight    small potatoes   you may say   a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to   but damnit   if it ain t broke   why fix it       more on this disappointed person s dashed expectations later      as jack cole   seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past    while he and his partner   played by keenen ivory wayans   are investigating a series of ritual killings   cole himself becomes a suspect   especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole    it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin   you just can t trust these homicide detectives     someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them   and hence   well   you know   that   glimmer man   thing    an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger   more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman   bob gunton     cole s former cia boss   brian cox   and deals involving chemical weapons    the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff   drawing   as with his other films   elements from the hotter films of the year   eg   se7en      it s the other changes that disappoint    for example   although there s a fair amount of violence in this movie   there s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans   probably the best known of the wayans tribe   how many are there   exactly     from television s   in living colour      wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal s bead adorned and brocade draped cole   keeping up his   are you crazy   part of the dialogue with wasted zest    as campbell   wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner s eccentric habits   but the chemistry between the two is minimal   and seagal s wooden comebacks make for painful watching    a cook in under seige 2   seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble    he chants   refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies    again   a benign   if trite   plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual    heck   he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film    is that a lot to ask of the seague    too much    seagal s best characteristic used to be that he knew his pur1e in this already complicated world of movies   to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages   and to do it silently   and alone    not for seagal   the snappy one liners of arnold and stallone   nor the attempts to show that he can act   much less think    no kindergarten cop   no oscar   just simple   unadulterated deathblows    that s really how it must have started   like minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing   knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else    we trusted him    we got to know him    now   betrayal    i don t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he s going to try to be funny again    i ll try   but it won t be easy    if you haven t watched the glimmer man yet   you might want to wait for the video to come out    it s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences    after all   if we can t depend on our fantasies   what can we depend on    the flying inkpot rating system   * wait for the tv2 broadcast     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan    everybody makes mistakes once in awhile    ,-1
    the 13th warrior   comes at the end of as summer where we ve already experienced man eating sharks     deep blue sea       man eating crocodiles     lake placid     and even a man hunting witch     the blair witch project        now     the 13th warrior   presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears    the story   if that s what you want to call it   follows ahmed ibn fahdlan   antonio banderas   an arabian poet who falls in love with his king s wife and is banished from his home land    he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them    eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men    thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission   and as you guessed it   ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth    he s not a warrior   and at first not well accepted by the vikings   but as the movie advances he ll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield    that s basically the entire plot    there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and   one assumes   drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn t just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story    instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer    the film is basically non  stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock    the battle scenes   although well choreographed   are not involving and not the least bit exciting    we don t get to know any of the characters and so we don t care who lives and who dies    the film   which wants to be beowolf   comes across more as a failed action adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels    it was directed by john mctiernan who s     the thomas crown affair   is also playing in theaters currently    and it s not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that     the 13th warrior   was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences    it belongs back on the shelf    ,-1
 when i watch a movie like mike nichols  what planet are you from    i can t help but feel like everyone is looking at me    it s as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness   eyes shooting daggers   quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard earned money to spend their time watching this        this        thing    i shift uncomfortably in my seat    i m reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second  or third rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted   funny   conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award    it s not my fault   i know it s not my fault   but dammit   someone s gotta be embarrassed   because it doesn t look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame    i m about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together   garry shandling   annette bening   john goodman   greg kinnear   mike nichols    do any of these names make you instantly shudder    the answer i would have come up with before today is no   this is quite a list of talented individuals we ve got here    granted   john goodman was in the flintstones   and greg kinnear has turned in some less than lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours   but even so   they ve got proven power as excellent supporting players    garry shandling has two television classics under his belt   his ingenious little it s garry shandling s show and the larry sanders show    and for god s sake   mike nichols directed the graduate   and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty    so explain this        this        thing    what planet are you from    purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop psychology mars/venus phenomenon    but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe inducing moments   the end result is   unsurprisingly   an unfunny   uninsightful   cringe inducing   thoroughly icky embarrassment    garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males   they reproduce through cloning   of course      his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth   find a female of the species   and impregnate her    they re taught how to pretend that they re listening by nodding and saying   uh huh     and how to compliment shoes    imagine my delighted surprise when   oh heavens   all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably   producing comedic results !  the lucky winner is fitted with a penis   since theirs   after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence        i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they re all just clones        whoops   too late      the penis   when aroused   tends to make a humming noise    the writers   when frequently strapped for ideas   tend to turn to this as a source of   comedy      it isn t funny the first time    it isn t funny the eighth time    it isn t funny the eighteenth time    if anything   it made me feel vaguely self conscious    garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear   who turns out to be a generic   unlikable scumbag    he s meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling s alien character   but he s so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside    kinnear s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples  work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents  1ition and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks    wow    what a magnificent bastard    nearly every man in the movie   in fact   is played as the same sort of sex driven slimeball    when kinnear s wife walks into the office   there isn t a single guy who doesn t trip   bump into a wall   or otherwise pratfall as if they d never seen a woman before    the few guys that aren t particularly slimeballs   such as john goodman s detective character   are simply uncommunicative workaholics    shandling meets up with annette bening   who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed   at one of kinnear s aa meetings    shandling s mission is to have a baby   and when he reveals his desires to her   bening instantly falls for him   and the next day        they get married    yup    the next day    cuz ya see   it turns out she wants a baby too !  bening s character perhaps was the most difficult to watch   especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty        if her character here is sup1ed to be representing the female of the species as a whole   then woe   i say   to the species    she s unfathomably insecure   and succumbs so easily to all of shandling s lines and lies that it borders on tragic    there s a point where   after thinking she may not be able to bear children   she learns that she is indeed pregnant    when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her   she strolls into the kitchen and sings   high hopes     you know   the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song   to deliver the news   and then says to him     now you can t leave me      we re sup1ed to empathize with shandling s discovery of the feeling of   guilt     but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing    and eventually   shandling falls in love with her        for real   i sup1e   though i m not sure exactly what prompted it    what s the message i derive from all this    men are liars   inherently empty creatures   but if you hang around long enough        well   maybe something will click    ha ha        ha    i m thankful such broad cynicism isn t frequently allowed to run so rampant    let s all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one    there s also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity    goodman   through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations   puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic   vibrating penis    it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered   that   thankfully   never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition    instead   it just dangles limply on the branch for a while   withers   and falls away    further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies    but let s not dwell on this any longer   i ve already wasted plenty of your time and my own    let s move on   forget about what we ve seen here   and get on with our lives    and to help us out   let s end things on a happy note        congratuations go out to annette bening   winner of this week s   title !

 ok   i admit it  i find camp amusement with the spice girls    yes   the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual   identities     they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of   girl power      but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn t enough to carry their big screen debut   a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world    the film begins amusingly enough   with a cheeky -1-17 esque title sequence in which the british quintet     scary     melanie brown       baby     emma bunton       sporty     melanie chisolm       ginger     geri halliwell     and   1h     victoria adams     are introduced one by one   to   much to my surprise   excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience   as they croon the silky ballad   too much     a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film      a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film     1   the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london s royal albert hall     2   a film producer   george wendt   and a screenwriter   mark mckinney   pitch various film ideas to the girls  manager   clifford   richard e   grant       3   a documentary film crew follows the girls     4   a pregnant   mate     naoki mori   of the group rapidly approaches her due date   and   5   a tabloid publisher   barry humphries   attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug   richard o brien      capped off by a live rendition of the girls  bouncy hit   say you ll be there     a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow   right    wrong   it s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches    i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves   but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them   much less a organized framework for all the   wacky   goings on    spice world jumps from vignette to vignette   subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense   at one minute having the girls meet with aliens   no joke   and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride    while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there  during a   dance bootcamp   scene   the girls sing the lyric   we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra     much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level    some gags are just plain pointless   such as roger moore s recurring role as the mysterious chief   who dispenses cryptic   metaphor heavy advice to clifford    the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond    ha ha    as weak as the script is   i think there s one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie   and that is the girls themselves    the point is not that they can t act   and   for the record   they really  can t    but that their individual personas   which works as a gimmick over the span of a four minute music video   are too thin to survive outside of the truncated   video bite mtv world    1h   who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions   comes off best by default because her persona   rich bitch   most easily translates into character in a film    baby s persona   young innocent     to a lesser extent   also works   but the remaining girls  identities are a little harder to flesh out    there really isn t much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often   which is  exactly  what fuller and spiers do     and   after all   what exactly entails being   ginger   or   scary      apparently   just their wardrobes    spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices  signature hit     wannabe      the song is as grating as ever   but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much needed shot in the arm   setting the stage for a wave of self referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters  film ideas   the film almost mirrors robert altman s the player in the way the film snails into itself      this section of the film   involving all manner of derring do involving a speeding bus   is perhaps its most effective   but it also points up how all the other storylines   the publisher   the documentary crew   lack a satisfactory payoff    spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family   and it will please the spice faithful    but this sloppy enterprise surely won t win them any new fans   which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states    once the hype disappears   spice world will likely serve as the the spices  final hurrah in america    ,-1
 sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime   but this has got to be one of the worst    a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting     the specialist   is about as exciting as an episode of   dragnet     and about as well acted    even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script   stupid and unlikable characters   and just plain nothingness    who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti climactic    unless you saw   blown away             the specliast   of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone   in comeback #19   i think     who plays a quiet   hermit like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something   but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant   james woods   who shows us exactly what over the top is   other than another bad sly film   accidentally killed some innocent people during a job    his credo is killing bad people   not innocents    and that s why he makes big bombs    so anyway   into his life steps the seductive sharon stone   who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son   eric roberts   of a cuban/miami kingpin   rod steiger   in an indecipherable accent   which is sometimes cuban   sometimes brando   sometimes scottish   etc      turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him   since he killed her parents when she was young    so she calls sly   leaves messages with him   sends him e mail   etc   about planting a bomb to kill roberts   which sly listens to obsessively   and while he works out naked    yea    also into his life   though again   comes woods   who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly    using the cops   he tries to set up traps   none which really work   so when sly calls him   he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone   getting so worked up by saying his must be improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open    these are the most exciting scenes in the film   and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film    the film tries to offer us a moody film noir   except with explosions   but comes up completely snake eyes    it s just a pretend film noir   making it a big waste of time    and for action buffs   the action scenes are pretty lame   with some really unrealistic looking special effects   a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub      then there s the much discussed sex scene between sly and stone   which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on   friends      their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy   because it shows us more of sly than stone    now let s guess who we d rather see naked   okay    stone s small but perky breasts   which we ve seen more times than harvey keitel s dick   or stallone s veiny ass   which isn t usually shown for a very good reason    i know i can t really judge it as a flaw of the film   but come on    the worst flaw of the film is this   it s boring    i mean   i was on caffeine when watching it   but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting    but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make    if you re in for some fun action   rent sly s earlier   demolition man     which sucks too   but in a much more entertaining fashion    skip this dull film   unless you want to see woods   or make fun of steiger s accent   or see stone s breasts again    ,-1
 `the skulls  is a laughably bad thriller   a teen orientated doppelganger of `the firm  so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor    certain moments are so pre1terous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter    i chuckled incessantly   all the way home    let me share    the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale   designed   i m sure   to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college      luke mcnamara   joshua jackson     a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year   highlights the latest skull scouting report    despite some anxiety and caution from others   luke accepts entry into the organization    soon after   he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women   driving a new car and marveling at the $2-1   -1-1-1 that somehow surfaced in his bank account    yeah   dude   pretty good deal eh    but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating   when circumstances become extreme   there is no way he can leave the society   except maybe as a drooling vegetable    the premise   although lacking in originality   certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense    unfortunately   `the skulls  is neither intriguing   nor suspenseful   nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting    it s just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack   the stars          but not the script    `the skulls  is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value   with the screenplay   by jon pogue   immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers    first off   upon their initiation into the skulls   each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm    afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar    will they never take this watch off    and what if they forget it by their bedside    perhaps their   secret  society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily ex1ed    on top of this   they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters    gee   why not member t shirts    but my favorite bit is this   the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual   agree  or   disagree  notions when making collective decisions    they are given official skull paddles    when flipped to one side   they indicate the member agrees with the pro1al    facing the op1ite way means a disagreement    wouldn t they merely express themselves verbally    hell no    they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote   and maybe afterward they can play ping pong    i m still chuckling about these ludicrous details   but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest    the cast   meanwhile   combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson s creek  crowd   and fuses the two together   ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout    but not entirely    accomplished actors like craig t   nelson   as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake   and william peterson   as fellow board member senator levritt   are dealt pathetic villain caricatures   and look suitably embarrassed handling them    and then there s christopher mcdonald   who has the capacity to be a fun   exciting actor    mcdonald s charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role   yes   pogue makes it a hat trick      i pray it was a `snatch the paycheck and run  exercise for all these actors    the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better    let s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character    paul walker   the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues    is bland but passable as caleb mandrake   the judge s son    walker preserves a straight face   even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie   `dad   i just killed a guy in the ritual room !        some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb   who plays luke s longtime chum chloe   and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics    it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one    or maybe not minute one   thanks to a decent set up from director rob cohen   who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style    it makes you wonder why he didn t flee indefinitely from the project   because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart  and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight  aren t superior cinema   they belong on the afi top 1-1-1 list when compared to this degrading trash    aside from unintentionally humoring the audience   `the skulls  gets little accomplished    the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical    the story is stuffed with ridiculous   formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick    instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization   we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage    we ve seen it all before   and better    `the skulls  is a feeble little circus of stupidity   so miscalculated that    while it would serve as a clever pun    a term like   boneheaded  seems just too generous    ,-1
 it s difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of   award winning   tv commercials   as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes    that said   hayes s feature film debut lives up to expectations   coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic    but occasionally   bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary    those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film s two stars   jake gyllenhall as the immuno deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over protective   hyper religious   reagan loving mother    gyllenhall s sweet natured delivery of jimmy s hilariously na   ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming of age story   jimmy is a bubble boy   a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ    a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld    his mom home schools jimmy   filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti sexual messages   until he s befriended by chloe   marley shelton     the beautiful girl next door    jimmy falls in love with chloe   but is afraid that his love will literally kill him   as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss    but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend   jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks addled cross country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love    the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy s rare handicap   regardless of what the film s protesters would have you believe     but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes   including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi    but even if you find stereotype humor funny   it s hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags    they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks    but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work   especially in the case of kurtz   who very bluntly shows the dark   hypocritical side of the religious right   and a wacky send up of a cult called   bright  n shiny     led by the inimitable fabio    unfortunately   a few giggles can t make bubble boy the riotous   off the wall comedy it so desperately wants to be    honestly   it s a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made   and i m not just saying that because it s so mediocre    how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn t seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many    and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real life bubble boy david philip vetter   maybe disney s wondering the same thing    hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile    ,-1
 bats is this year s camp flick    with the world s worst dialogue   cheesiest premise and stupidest editor   this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity    as for the rest of us   well        i d say skip it   but looking at the box office figures for this one   it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway    follow their lead and you ll spare yourself 9-1 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot    i love alfred hitchcock s the birds   almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based    it saddens me even more   then   to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats    when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town   the authorities call in a batologist   dina meyer   to investigate    it turns out that a creepy scientist   bob gunton   has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab   making them smarter and more vicious    why has he done this   you ask    because   you see   it is apparently a scientist s job to make things   a little better     even if that means the death of all mankind    so the batologist   her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff   lou diamond phillips   have to kill all the bats and save the world    of course   that can t happen before they wallow in some guamo   bat shit   for the uninitiated     get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture    consider   for example   a scene where two people are in a bat cave    the bats are all sleeping   but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out    what do they do    do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can    nope    they stand there for a while   transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes    what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes    we don t even get to see what s going on   the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick    all we know is that bats are attacking    how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery    a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies   and bats sure could use some    of course   director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor   but it is so conventional it doesn t really go anywhere    most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist s wisecracking sidekick   leon     who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like   i hate bats !    some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality   they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept    i hate characters who exist for the sole pur1e of spouting lame one liners    playing such characters does not help actors  careers    still   i sup1e that if you re looking for a movie that is   so bad it s good     you could do worse than bats    it does have a tremendous amount of camp value    i m not   recommending   the movie because   quite frankly   it sucks   and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it    more power to them    ,-1
 starring shawnee smith   donovan leitch   ricky paull goldin   kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 196-1 s classic   a term that i use very loosely to define the original   about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way    now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel    the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn t exactly hurt it either    fast forward to the late  8-1 s    steve mcqueen isn t in the remake   this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years      nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role    that is unless you count matt dillon s brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter    the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original    the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets    it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets    the special effects in this movie are cheesy   like the original s    unlike the original   they don t look campy   they just look cheap    one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith    she is very attractive and can actually act   which is more than i can say about some of her costars    in terms of plot   a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky    seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite    anyway   the pink stuff has a taste for humans    the more people it absorbs   the bigger it gets    and it isn t the friendliest goop on the block either    anyway   it attacks this little town and it s up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it    not really   but that is how it seems    this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original    as i ve already said   this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap   badly acted   and badly written than campy    in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness    although   star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon    the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple    they all stunk out loud    although some of the film s smaller roles are filled with some actors that   while not big stars   are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows    it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as 1sible    sadly   it doesn t work very well    if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town   then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original       although that isn t so hot either      this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities    ,-1
 toward the bottom of the  8-1s action movie barrel lies action jackson   the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes    this carl   apollo creed   weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs   evil establishment crook   and relies on all the  8-1s trappings   from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer    somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs   although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs    weathers is action jackson   a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques    speaking of one past criminal apprehension   jackson s superior yells     you tore his arm off !    jackson replies     he had a spare      jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane   craig t   nelson   and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson    after hearing what jackson thinks of him   stone says     i take it you re not one of dellaplane s friends         not unless they changed the definition     jackson glowers    and of course it turns out stone is mrs   dellaplane    faux pas   jackson        not everything is happy in motown   people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa    it s all up to jackson to stop it   and his only lead lies in vanity   not his own      wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson    she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane s nightclub    after singing one particularly sultry number for him   she saunters over and complains     i expected a standing ovation      he responds     you re getting one     and it s damn clever because he s sitting down at the time    prince wouldn t even let out an innuendo that lame and he s the king of the horndogs        or at least the prince    it s a testament to the  8-1s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 3-1 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie    action jackson is another variation on the   unlikely partners   buddy action flick   with jackson lugging junkie vanity around    this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade   and with the dialogue they re given   there s not much room for improvement    my favorite is when vanity   feeling the effects of drug withdrawal   says     i feel like my teeth are hollow   my gums are made of dry rubber and someone s trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head      jackson s response is     i think i felt that way once    they called it love      you ll understand when i say watch this at your own risk    serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !  ,-1
 if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 8-1 s   they d agree d   c   cab is the quintessential   usa up all nite   movie    it s one of those childish r rated movies that kids would love but can t see until it s edited for tv    it s also one of those pointless   almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs    and   strike three   it pairs mr   t with gary busey    i heard gilbert say d   c   cab had   an all star cast     but i m still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement    when third billing goes to a two minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara   as herself     you can t say a damn thing about all star casts    likewise for token appearances by marsha   roz   warfield   paul rodriguez and   politically incorrect   host bill maher   before he was somebody    appearing in d   c   cab pretty much had the op1ite effect on everyone else   especially irene   i m gonna live forever   cara    d   c   cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher   who would go on to direct batman forever   about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs    you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice   this would be the result   except here you have such interesting characters as the   token white guy     busey   who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world   the token jive talker named tyrone   charlie barnett   who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word   honkey   as much as 1sible   the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains   mr   t    a real stretch for him     the aspiring musician waiting for his big break   maher     the mexican gigolo   rodriguez     the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living   warfield   and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living   adam baldwin      we ve all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 8-1 s    some are fun to watch and some are actually funny    this one is more or less neither    you d think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent   whatever     but d   c   cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis   culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him    it s a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality    d   c   cab has rightly earned its 1ition on   usa up all nite      ,-1
 written by alex cox   tod davies   terry gilliam and tony grisoni  directed by terry gilliam  i ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid    dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded   you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are   no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat   and no idea how long the ride will last    then there s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine laced dose    mushrooms   on the other hand   offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel   a steady   reassuring assent   a short period of thrilling motion and color   and then a smooth landing    acid is for daredevils   mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy    my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas   director terry gilliam has made an acid movie   when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie    full of shocking sight gags   aggressive images and grotesque comic performances   the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s   thompson s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world view from the inside out    but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well made film   gilliam has produced a mixed bag    fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self professed   gonzo   journalist hunter s   thompson   johnny depp   and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta   benicio del toro     came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971    operating under the pseudonyms of   raoul duke   and   dr    gonzo     the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender   then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite   cocaine   tequila and a rainbow of multi colored uppers and downers    they terrorize every one they meet   mostly because every one they meet terrifies them    duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town   then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge    dr   gonzo becomes enamored of a thick bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane s   white rabbit   reaches its climax    and these guys don t just trash hotel rooms   they rape them   humiliate them and leave them for dead    that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence   depending on your point of view    thompson s book   besides being a hilarious read   has stood the test of time as an important historical document    it simultaneously ex1ed the 6-1 s drug culture for the sham that it was and ex1ed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die    pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson s message   but the truth is that   stripped to its bare essentials   what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy    it s a cheech and chong movie    you re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results   see johnny take drugs   see johnny fall down    there s nothing wrong with this concept   but gilliam tries too hard    this is a frantic movie   all sweaty close ups   wide angle lenses   dutch tilts and other worldly lighting schemes    there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen    but to what end    much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson s book   and there are some priceless comic observations    but you re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work    this brings us to the performances   which strike me as all wrong    depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c   scott in patton   a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson s dialogue    in between his several puking scenes   del toro fares better as dr   gonzo   but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost    watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago   with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads   now that would have been something to see    it s interesting to note that alex cox   credited as a co writer on the screenplay   was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over    as much of a fan as i am of gilliam s work   cox would have been the better choice    sid and nancy   cox s best work   covered essentially the same subject matter   but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film    gilliam commits the compound sin of over directing his film while being uncertain of his pur1e    what kind of movie was he trying to make   anyway    it doesn t try to be a cautionary tale   and it doesn t work as broad comedy    if he had considered more carefully his pur1e   the result would have been a much more interesting film    but i don t want to be too hard on it    there are some truly funny moments   and if you re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it    i do   however   recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance   i guarantee it will enhance the effect    ,-1
 the best thing about     lake placid   is that it s only 8-1 minutes long and when it s over you re glad that you didn t waste more than an hour and a half of your time    it s nothing more than a bad rip off of     jaws     and i think that s being kind      it was written by david e   kelly     ally mcbeal     as a horror comedy but fails at both   miserably    i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once    the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in     anaconda      the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine    that brings the local sheriff   brendan gleeson   and a fish and game warden   bill pulman   to investigate    also   a paleontologist   bridget fonda   from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover   oliver platt   flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast    soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it    there s also an eccentric old lady   betty white   who lives by the lake and has a few secrets    as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor   h2-1   don t go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don t have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either    the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting   they re all basically idiots    if they had any brains the croc wouldn t have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn t have put themselves in half of the situations that they did    but then again   if they were smart there wouldn t be a movie    basically     lake placid   is best undiscovered    ,-1
 that is   unless you re one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters    i can tell you one thing now   they gave the entire movie away    why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me    however   if they * hadn t * given it away   the film would ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter    obviously   the producers thought they could remake   the deep end of the ocean     throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama       double jeopardy   offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones   who got first billing even though he didn t see to be on screen half as much as judd did    it also offers some genuinely funny   clever   or full of tension moments   my favorite   judd waking up in the coffin     but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot    half the time i m wondering whether i m watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries   which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised    judging by the beginning   end   and a huge chunk of the middle   i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too    the movie s stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 3-1 minutes worth of material    implausible material   no less    loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside   too many times in the movie i thought     that is * not * 1sible *      that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies   but not one like   double jeopardy   that tries to pass itself off as serious drama    everything seems dragged out   overplayed    when they should ve kept us in the dark   they let the cat out of the bag too early    ,-1
 i had an epiphany today    it occurred to me while i was watching   house on haunted hill      it is as follows   if a trailer makes the film it s advertising look like a trashy   stupid movie   well guess what    chances are   there * is * truth in advertising    too bad i didn t trust my own instincts when something or the other 1sessed me to see this movie    i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of   sleepy hollow      that and   dogma   started too late in the afternoon for my schedule    an hour of   angel   or   buffy   is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face    i wish i d seen it when it was halloween    at least i would have been forgiving    hey   tis the season    the movie was scary   albeit very confusing   dizzying   and nauseating   at first   but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn t going anywhere    now i truly appreciate films like   scream       halloween     or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic    that s what spooks people out   the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know    there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with    sure   utterly unpredictable is good   too   but that s different from utterly nonsensical    hohh   house on haunted hill     on the other hand            well let s just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh so cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago    riiiiight    y know   that just sends chills down my spine    yeah    just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil    ooooooo    hint   blood and guts only work a few times    sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it s just ketchup and props and you ve got to come up with something better than that    there were just too many things in this movie that we ve all seen before   from the inevitable   plot developments   of strangers unwittingly trapped together   strangers turning against each other   the evil manifesting itself   the dead coming back for a last scare    each was more predictable than the last    why didn t these fools just stay together in one place anyways    sheesh    was i grossed out    yes    did i get spooked a few times    yes    but why    i get really disturbed when there is no why    when there weren t random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect   which wasn t that good either   trust me   and the scare   the film was filled with drab   laughable dialogue    the characters were incredibly flat and cliched    not to mention downright annoying    you ve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives   of course they re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night    jeez   i thought no one fell for those   you may already be a winner   things anymore    and of course   all three gals are babes    i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of   shine   ended up in this movie    keep that up   geoff   and you ll qualify for the next batman venture    the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because   well   he just cracks me up    and famke jansen   sp      because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan    pierce brosnan   hey   i willingly endured   dante s peak   three times for him        all right   i concede    there were a couple of things i enjoyed    that perverted little amusement park at the beginning    i probably won t ride a rollercoaster for a while    and the machine they used to drive geoffrey s character mad   see   i don t even remember their names      the machine   not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it    i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie    it wouldn t have redeemed the film   but at least it would have made me feel better    but no   they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending    thank god they didn t add a kiss at the end or i would have puked    god   there is no hope    ,-1
 director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film   the dreadful comedy steal big   steal little   was funny    keanu   i d rather play music than play another action hero   reeves is the grad student on the run   who   along with his superfluous sidekick   rachel weisz     has been framed for a sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks       the mushroom cloud explosion is a knock out and easily the best part of the movie    or   as one audience member succinctly summed it up     whoa        false information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run   fleeing over open drawbridges   across icy lakes   and through the corridors of power at a top secret   underground energy facility    aiding and abetting is the team s shady mentor   played in an excellent but so  what performance by morgan freeman       brit brian cox is also about   as the behind the scenes bad guy    he has some fun fiddling with a southern accent      unfunny   overscored   and without a single shred of suspense   chain reaction is * the * summer movie to walk out on    if you make it to the end   a mess of cross cutting involving another imminent explosion   you ll hear somebody say   i guess it s time to go      heed that warning    ,-1
 one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often acclaimed director sidney lumet s   gloria     a remake of the 198-1 john cassavetes film   had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre    suddenly   i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before   i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in    when a movie is over   aren t we sup1ed to think about it for a while   and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with    i thought so   but   for one   i saw this particular picture by myself   and #2   even if i had been with someone there wouldn t have been anything to talk about in the first place    to be sure     gloria   begins with a stirring   rather poignant prologue in which a seven year old boy s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters   in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it    right before the men broke in   of course   his father gave him the disc to escape with    eventually   the boy   named nicky nunez   jean luke figueroa     is caught by the mobsters   and taken back to their apartment    meanwhile   gloria   sharon stone   has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn t commit and returns to her ex boyfriend   jeremy northam   to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime    when he refuses to give it to her   and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky   she leaves with him in order to save his life   but not before holding the men at gunpoint   stealing all of their money   and forcing them to strip nude    gloria is the type of fast talking   smart mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people   and she never expected to be stuck with a kid   but she has a heart of gold   don t they always in this type of movie   and is only trying to protect the boy   whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with    the previous incarnation of   gloria   by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands   remains unseen by me   but was no doubt superior   even though i can t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one   regardless of the director or stars    there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original   but the film itself is simply lifeless   with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn t completely unbearable to watch    i liked   for example   a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at   and keeps turning the car around   then driving a little ways   then slamming on the brakes and turning around again    these bright moments   however   appear long and far between   and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria   which is both painfully predictable and by the numbers    throughout   my mind was repeatedly asking the question     who really cares      as gloria   sharon stone has adopted an over the top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn t sound realistic at all    in the beginning   in fact   i was amazed at how amateurish stone s performance was   but as the film progressed she got better    although not one of her better turns   stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored    jean luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag    all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted   none more than cathy moriarty   an entertaining actress in her own right   who is billed fourth and has all of one scene   as gloria s friend whom she turns to for help    sony   the studio that released   gloria     obviously does not have any faith in the film   and i don t blame them    they declined to screen the picture for critics   which is never a good sign   particularly with the high profile people involved    although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is   just look at the spectacular   in dreams     which failed to even make the top 1-1 last week     i have a suspicion   gloria   is going to vanish from theaters faster than   ishtar     judging from the opening night 7   -1-1 p   m   showing i saw it at   where there were about ten to fifteen people present   counting myself    although stone can be an impressive actress   just watch her in 1995 s   casino   or 1996 s   last dance   if you don t believe me   and sidney lumet can be a respectable director   there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of   gloria   was worth remaking or   for that matter   why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful    ,-1
 pre review note   seeing as the only concern of body shots is   sex     i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review    because of this   i will try to vary word descriptions of   sex     meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms   and \ or your name is jerry falwell   you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen     so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend   fret not   it s most likely just another way of referring to   sex      i think we d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review    though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what    body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously   in the way you d normally expect to see a violent attack    it s about people who think about screwing   seek it out   and talk about it    these are things we all do   sometimes    the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts    their lives center around the next sexual encounter   but they seemed depressed    it s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek    at its core body shots is a message movie   the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition    michael cristoffer   who directed gia   another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil   is a moralist with nothing new to say    his characters don t communicate anything of interest to each other   so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera    they voice simplistic platitudes like   i like to come   or   sex without love equals violence      huh    and yes that is as complex as this movie s observations get    the characters are stupid and shallow   with not one registering as anything more    the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure   then the after math   the morning after   of such events    we meet the characters as they speak directly to us   confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy    i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them   giving you the pros and cons   but for this film i cannot    i m not trying to be clever or witty   but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others    with the exception of trent   played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman     the rest fade into each other   a patchwork of fake breasts   defined abs   pearly white teeth   and creamy   flawless skin    i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one   only because his character gets the worst lines     sex without love equals violence        in between all the confessionals   cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial   with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning    the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me    this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining    if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k obsessed   fine   i don t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way   but cristoffer only gives us one side    additionally that one side isn t even entertaining   the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness    or realism    one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters    they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason   other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other       alas   if it could only be that easy       kidding of course     then   not only isn t it erotic   it isn t real    it doesn t feel like an authentic sexual encounter    every f * * k scene in this film   and there are many   is treated in the same unsexy manner    body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film    it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it   and most of all   it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it    the resulting search for nookie   and you can take that cookie         over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow    the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred    the film shows us two separate versions of the 1sible rape   one where it is consensual the other where it is not   and in both versions the young actress playing the 1sible victim gets her shirt torn off    this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently   and if memory serves me i can t think of one film that has done so   and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 8-1 s next to wall street    unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care   not the writer   the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 9-121-1 spin off    paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here   though boogie nights succeeded    it was similarly moralistic   but it gave us two different viewpoints   it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters   and it showed us the 1sible fall out of such a decision    the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here   but anderson seemed to care about them    he gave them heart    cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones    he preaches to us   by using his characters to preach to us    this is not the way to get any message across    why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin  skins    cristofer kind of does that   though without an ounce of insight   and with a helping of leering exploitation    ,-1
 i m guessing    and from the available evidence   it s not a great guess    that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess   stupidity   ego and power mongering    if so   the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history    it has already been well documented that the original title   an alan smithee film   became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re cuts against the will of director arthur hiller   prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors  guild mandated pseudonym of alan smithee    that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas   as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor    and you could just smell the disaster brewing    if you re unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn   you ll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up    ostensibly   it s a pseudo documentary account of a director named alan smithee   eric idle   who loses control of a big budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone   whoopi goldberg and jackie chan   all of whom appear as themselves      when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called   an alan smithee film      which   of course   it already is    smithee steals the -1ative of the film and threatens to destroy it    among the parties interviewed are the film s producer james edmunds   ryan o neal   and studio boss jerry glover   richard jeni     who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them    it s bad enough that burn hollywood burn has    literally    not a single laugh for its entire   blissfully brief 84 minutes    what makes it even worse is eszterhas  insistence upon telling every bad joke not once   but twice or even three times    michael ovitz references   showgirls references   oral sex references   whoopi goldberg/ted danson references    all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas  stock in trade    the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency   notably with the hilarious use of the word   feminist   as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film    by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film makers the brothers brothers   cleverly identified as   bad a     and   badder a       among other unprintable things     you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified    those documentary captions   for all their leaden obviousness   allow the best insight into what s so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn    not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit   eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears    the producer is a   liar   who   slept in the white house     the media are   maggots   and   leeches   working for publications like   the new york slimes   and   newsleak     with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don t miss the joke      it doesn t even matter that eszterhas tags   penile implant   after his own name when he makes a cameo   because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self deprecation    this is a petulant schoolboy s idea of satire    pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth    the last stomach churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out takes over the closing credits   the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away    perhaps it was just a final   desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some pur1e behind the film   or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career    pity everyone involved with this excessive   ego driven   satire   of excess and ego    it s too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this    otherwise   you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees    ,-1
    meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood !      screams the television ads for   hanging up     disastrously written by real life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton    make me laugh again !  not only is   hanging up   misadvertised   since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co stars   lisa kudrow and diane keaton   little more than extended cameos   but they don t actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes    and we are sup1ed to believe their strong bond   and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship   despite them being apart for the majority of the running time    excuse me   again   while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion    eve marks   meg ryan   is the middle mozzell sister   still living in the california town where she grew up   and with a husband   adam arkin   and pre teen son   jesse james      her elderly   wisecracking father   lou   walter matthau   in his brightest performance in years   has just recently been put into the hospital   in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer s   even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him      while eve s relationship with her mother   cloris leachman   is nearly nonexistent   since she ran out on lou and her children years ago   she has had her fair share of up s and down s with lou   who used to be an alcoholic    her older sister is georgia   diane keaton     an editor for the self titled magazine     georgia     while maddy   lisa kudrow   is the youngest   a soap opera actress    interestingly   their professions are given   but we not once ever see them working at their jobs   or   for that matter   learn much of anything about them    maddy   georgia   and eve do not see each other much anymore   their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart   but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another    and they talk    and talk    and talk        in fact   the telephone is the major star of the film   even more so than ryan   as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92 minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long    if you are able to get through the opening half hour   in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them   you will surely survive the rest    the question is   who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating   self involved pat on the back    how could a comedy drama that has the star power of meg ryan   lisa kudrow   and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways    issues from the past involving the 1sible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up   but the film isn t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner   and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood   it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought    also   it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another   but no dynamic metamorphosizes    and when they do reunite in the finale   their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three minute scene in which they argue like little children    you can see the impending death coming a mile away   and it conveniently occurs in the next scene   so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves   and with each other    you think to yourself     the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food fight     and like clockwork   it also occurs by the end credits    meg ryan is a versatile actress   look no further than 1998 s   hurlyburly   or 1994 s   when a man loves a woman       despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies    with   hanging up     the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron   a writer/director/hack who shouldn t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big budget   high profile debacle    even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department   she nonetheless is very good   and the two scenes that work   flashbacks to christmas 1988   when she had a heartbreaking run in with her mother   and to halloween 1993   when lou crashed her son s birthday party in a drunken stupor   are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations    diane keaton   as georgia   is better as an actress than a director here   but that is a wildly feeble compliment    what is more than a little far fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow   although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children   she is no more than five years ryan s senior    yeah   right    lastly   poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big screen venture   after her even more thin role in 1999 s   analyze this      kudrow isn t given enough time to create a full personality with maddy   so it isn t her fault she doesn t register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue    if anything   though   kudrow is a real talent   and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time   as in her brilliantly nuanced   oscar caliber work in 1998 s   the op1ite of sex      if you are a fan of kudrow s   and who isn t       do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than   hanging up   does in its entirety    as eve s hardworking husband   adam arkin is   predictably   squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do   until a subplot reveals itself midway through   only to never be mentioned again    cloris leachman   as with ryan and matthau   makes a small   but noticeable impression with her   albeit   very brief appearance   while edie mcclurg   as a rosy cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback   manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production    nearly all the emotions displayed within   hanging up   are patently manufactured   and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters   aside from eve   why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats    if   for some bizarre     twilight zone    type of reason   you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film   my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over    saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions    ,-1
 under any other circumstances   i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review    however   in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful   a minute dissection of the ending is necessary    even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes   do proceed at your own risk    the movie opens   quite poorly   i might add   as child psychologist malcolm crowe   bruce willis   looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene   and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm s past patients    distraught   the suicidal man   a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg   shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself    cut to the   next fall     as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case   a trouble young man named cole   haley joel osment   one of the only child actors in a while i didn t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument      after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences   we learn that cole has   the sixth sense     the gift of being able to communicate with the dead    and this   as they say   is where the healing begins    the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film   one of roger ebert s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of   siskel and ebert        although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons   i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise   i ve always been a sucker for surprise endings   my favorite movie is the usual suspects   and rarely dislike a film that sports one    here   since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film s conclusion   the 1sibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending   something i ve fallen victim to in the past   was eliminated    and indeed   my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment    stripped of the element of surprise   the film was put to the task of showing what it really had   instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion    after seeing its true colors   i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is   despite what the many champions of the movie may say   void of any real power    it s a neat concept   but not one that justifies being made into a feature length movie    in fact   the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the sup1edly earth shattering revelation that is yet to come    and when the final moments do come   it s a huge letdown   the end makes no sense at all    it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level    i won t go into any details   but suffice to say that   as far as i can tell   it -1ates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder    now   in all fairness   i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending   however stupid it may be   had it not been revealed to me before hand    however   i feel very confident that i   as well as anyone who had seen a few   twilight zone   episodes   would have seen it coming a mile away    the fact that movie goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped    ironically   to fully appreciate the best scene   that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl s funeral     the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy    i wouldn t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn t   by pure dumb luck   caught   dateline nbc   the other week when they did a feature story on it    despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment   where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace       in the end   the sixth sense is too chalk full of contradictions and just isn t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation    ,-1
 brian de palma s snake eyes stars nicolas cage s evil twin   who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother    like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood   cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload    de palma   whose last great film   the untouchables   was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic    in snake eyes   he manages to elicit some of the worst performances 1sible out of a skilled cast    only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material    the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by the numbers thriller    ryuichi sakamoto s atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene    heavy on the long violin notes   its rhythm is punctuated by thunder       the script by de palma and lost world s david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise    only the latter is achieved      cage plays rick santoro   a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money    the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held    with a flashy   bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone   rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn t know when to shut up    spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog   he screams such lines as     i was made for the sewer   baby !    actually the line is more apro1 for the movie as a whole    sinise plays kevin dunne   a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy   who has come to watch the fight    but most people in the film are not who they seem to be   and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess    the plot   which is told in endless flashbacks   concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen   that adjective is   of course   redundant in hollywood thrillers    the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again   sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not    although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence   this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie    the movie s outline has some promise   but the movie itself is leaden    the film takes itself all too seriously    at best   it is a 194-1s style b movie    a little humor would have helped the script some   but a complete rewrite would have been better    and   although i hate to say it   a different director would have been the biggest improvement    snake eyes runs 1   39    it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers    ,-1
 a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets    the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities    the result is merely an academic exercise   leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn t build on to show them as the poets they were    on paper   this shouldn t have been so terrible    it had a talented director in agnieszka holland     the secret garden       a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton   dangerous liaisons     and a capable cast    but the film was done in by its inept script   the unappealing way the film was directed   and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud    i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film   with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius   spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade    he   especially   looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be    but when the two of them were together   it looked like a mismatch    leonardo s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude   yet we know from rimbaud s poetry   that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring    the film opens in 1t revolutionary france in 1871   the 16 year old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems    he accepts verlaine s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home   and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville    once there   rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household   has an immediate conflict with verlaine s busty 18 year old wife mathilde   romane     and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family s money   even though he has nothing else in common with her    when verlaine states     poets can learn from one another     rimbaud replies in a haughty tone     only if they re bad poets      he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship    verlaine proves to be weak willed   beating his wife regularly   and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud    when mathilde s father kicks rimbaud out of the house   verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers    it s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets   which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce    in brussels   verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail    while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19    he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun runner   and after ten years there   comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37    the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying    the film ends on a whimper       with  verlaine talking with rimbaud s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still 1sesses   which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published    this film was especially annoying because rimbaud s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film   as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry    i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film   but whatever it was   it just didn t work    it certainly didn t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so called father of modern poetry    ,-1
 in our time    in our modern world   where the cool rule   it s hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming  the man     and yet   film after film   after film   is based on his everlasting magic    in warner brothers  latest production   shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat   while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away    though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare s  romeo and juliet    its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york   is very hard to associate with shakespeare s poetry    the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city   the afro americans against the chinese    the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered    the afro americans are immediately suspected   but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers    it is at this point that han   the romeo of the story   finds out about his brother s death    escaping from a prison in china   he returns to united states to avenge his brother s fate    but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks   he falls in love with a mysterious beauty    the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy      there s only a weak echo of shakespeare s talent in this disappointing production    and there are more problems besides its title    of course we don t call it a deformation of a great masterpiece    we call it  modernization     it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics   without any car chases and gun fights    this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing    kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn t need to be updated   because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature    and as long as love   hate   honesty and corruption do exist   everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare    i must admit that i found  rome must die  very confusing    i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak   since it is his first attempt at directing    he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision    unfortunately he completely forgot about character  and story developments    his latest picture is therefore visually impressive   but intellectually hollow    the love story between han   jet li   and trish   aalyah     and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified    jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice    their achievement save this film from being completely braindead   but they are not actors   and therefore can not act    they are nothing more than two celebrities put together    the other actors   including isaiah washington   russell wong   henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances    delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality    but there s more than acting to worry about    even with li s incredible skills in martial arts   the action scenes   though technically excellent   are too long and story updates simply embarrassing    to make a long story short    romeo must die  is not intelligent enough to be a thriller   not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film    it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to  romeo and juliet    so the film is completely stuck   not sure of what to be    and in the end it s nothing    there are no performances worthy of notice   no interesting character  or story surprises    so again   the only good thing about it is its technical achievement    this film can boast of great sound   fast paced editing   solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences    the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre    it is mostly provided by aalyah s enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists   that create a kind of  ghetto feel  to it    but when i think back   it s not much i remember from this  production     as in almost every summer movie   there are some interesting scenes   but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects    it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities   simply because it doesn t have any    for someone who has never read shakespeare   it s another popcorn film    for those of us who has   it s a waste of money   time and brain cells    ,-1
 isn t it the ultimate sign of a movie s cinematic ineptitude when you can t think of much to say about it other than   it sucks      one of the first official year 2-1-1-1 releases   supernova is such a movie    i can t seem to get past one word adjectives with this one   although   boring       stupid   and   absurd   doesn t amount to much of a review    a shame    i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate    but c est la vie    here goes nothing    i ll keep it short    i sup1e the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill   48 hours   removed his name from the movie   requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee    the film s fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press   an event usually signifying a studio s lack of confidence in a particular movie    hill s and mgm s actions were prudent    when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident   a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer   for some reason   james spader   is forced to take command    the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and   on arrival   picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony    one of the crew members   angela bassett   knows this passenger   who is played by peter facinelli   and has some bad feelings about it    and we all know what that means    this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo    a jellylike substance the pur1e of which is unknown   though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it    another one of the crew members experiences this first hand   after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo   he does some impressive handstand pushups    evidently   touching this enigmatic egg shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger    how    why    the movie never bothers to explain    soon enough though   spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad   being chased by the all of a sudden superhuman facinelli    to be honest   i don t even remember exactly why    i just remember that i didn t care    supernova s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas   such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb   but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing    in fact   everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set    well   the effects are good   though there s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i m not sure whether that s so remarkable an accomplishment    the performances are hardly worth talking about    i m not even sure i can call what s here   performances     though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger    james spader is not a bad actor   but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i ve seen in a while   mostly because he isn t given a character with a personality    the action scenes are just as bland   since they re pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren t particularly entertaining the first time around    and since the action scenes are everything to this movie   it s pretty much dead in the water    and for the life of me   i can t figure out why it s called supernova    ,-1
    idle hands   is distasteful   crass and derivative    if an original thought found its way into this horror comedy it would die of loneliness    plus   you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen agers the week after the tragedy in littleton   colo    the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen agers    the plot   what little there is   deals with anton   devon sawa     a high school slacker who s hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming 1sessed    along the way the hand kills anton s parents and his two best friends    the friends   also slackers   are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them    that is the level of this s atrocity s humor    the movie treats death as a joke       idle hands   is gruesome and morbid    the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish    i realize this is sup1ed to pass for comedy   but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen    it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life    and i can only presume that the writers of   idle hands     terri hughes and ron milbauer   were trying to make some statement about today s young people and their values in a satiric vein    however   it s hard to laugh at death these days   especially ones involving young people    with the real horrors of the world put before us on television   a stale pastry such as   idle hands   should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths       idle hands   is bad   no matter the circumstances in the world outside    but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings    the time is not right for this type of movie    and as far as   idle hands   goes   the time may never be right    this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema    ,-1
 a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings    family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years   and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand wringing detail    still   i can t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love    and after it   i still can t    bye bye love is rarely funny   more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv movie fare    only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion    bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children    dave   matthew modine     a father of two   is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend   vic   randy quaid   is a foul humored father of three about to go on a rare date   donny   paul reiser   pines for his ex wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma   eliza dushku      over the course of the weekend   the three men face various crises   including vic s blind date from hell   janeane garofolo   and donny s growing estrangement from emma    the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo   and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality    randy quaid is the best of the three   bitter without being irritating   gleefully spiteful without being frightening    his run ins with is ex wife   lindsey crouse   are a bit over played   though   and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist   rob reiner   is gimmicky and implausible    he does get bye bye love s best sub plot   a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo   and he does a great slow burn    paul reiser really has only one character   his slightly befuddled   uptight nice guy   mad about you   persona   but he does it well    as a personality   he is appealing   but as a character   he becomes pretty boring here    matthew modine   is   quite simply   terrible    this isn t a performance good enough to be called mailed in   he even forgot to put a stamp on it    modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under written role   looks bored most of the time   and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it s all his father s fault he s such a cad    carolco s executives   whose entire future is resting on modine s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island   must be sweating buckets right now    bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie   because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids   making it just another   dating in the 9-1s   movie    when the movie does deal with the children at all   it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry   perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug   perhaps not    even more confusing is a sub plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald s and befriends a troubled youth    it is a sad end to flanders  career   getting caught up in a truly annoying over use of mcdonald s as a location   a plot device and   apparently   a major advertiser    even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent child relationships   it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off   because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break ups and their effects on children    any way you slice it   it is a bad situation for kids   and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue    it is left to the dads  romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is   and it isn t enough    there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood   but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching    bye bye love is a genuine shame    ,-1
 according to the publicity material   with this movie the directors   hope to restore good old fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness      hmm    you never know   they just might be on to something    what with the rise of geek chic   lounge music and seventies fashion   the ever contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own    but then   i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it    it s cheesy all right   but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch    that s a shame   because   in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more    woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise   roy munson    the movie opens in the fifties with roy s dad dishing out the reader s digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls   shifting to the 7-1s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever    the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray   as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken    it s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good   he gives the wry   derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy    mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job   then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy s hand    then it s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat   balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand    he s hopeless until he meets ishmael   randy quaid     an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege    so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno   picking up pretty hustler claudia   vanessa angel   on the way    with the exit of bill murray   the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go   and that s        dumb and dumber    yes   indeed   kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour   peter and bobby farrelly   the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle    so   prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands   distended nipples   ridiculous hair and bull semen    get set for stock fish out of water situations when city boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community   or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking   striptease and unchristian neighbour socking    now   don t get me wrong   there s nothing wrong with cheap humour   and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy    the trouble is that these jokes aren t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction    it lurches from sports movie to amish mocking to road trip to sentimental melodrama     pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent pro1al   and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack     never quite getting it all together    some gags fall flat from a lack of build up   while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don t do anything    why the long   unfunny fight in the car park    why two of these    why does that guy wear mascara   or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it    the film is full of these half thought through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer   grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying     wouldn t that be funny        well   no   actually    the actors don t do the movie much favours either    woody harrelson comes off okay   plausibly acting dumb   smart   cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it   but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham   and vanessa angel has no talent   like schwarze-1ger   she seems more convincing playing a computer creation than a human    take the tv series weird science       please        even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie s climax    all in all   a fairly useless attempt at comedy   and a certified no hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance    we ll have to look to a reinspired john waters   or perhaps somebody from down under     strictly bowling     anyone     for the definitive bowling comedy    the flying inkpot s rating system   * wait for the video     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    ,-1
 starring kiefer sutherland   reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen    freeway is giving me second thoughts    freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood    only in the nineties   little red riding hood is a foul mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon   and the big bad wolf is a serial killer   keifer sutherland      to top that pathetic premise off    reese goes to visit granny and you ll never guess who s waiting under the cover s in granny s bed    keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented   yet underrated actors   and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star    so what are they doing in this movie    after seeing the end result   undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question    you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review    the answer is quite simple    i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary    i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it    note to keifer   you wonder why you aren t a bigger star in hollywood    because you keep making movies like this    note to reese   you were great in fear   what happened this time    note to both   don t worry about it too much   no one saw this movie anyway    bottom line    i m still shaking my head    don t waste your time on this turkey    if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie   go rent flatliners or young guns    reese witherspoon s abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear   a great thriller    do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies    but stay as far away from freeway as you 1sibly can    ,-1
 synopsis   in   sooner than you think   america   the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad   a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs    a dangerous criminal   however   attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them    comments   so   what do an ex gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop   a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem   and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common    why   they re all members of blade squad   an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms   rollerblades   and jetpacks !  they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron s aliens    yes   it s blade squad   the fox network s wednesday night movie of the week    this   movie     marking its dubious world premiere today   curiously has a number of guest stars       how can a movie have guest stars      you may ask    well   blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a 1sible tv series packaged as a movie    blade squad is dumb    blade squad is loud    blade squad is obnoxious    blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long lived tv series    why not    after all   television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars     knight rider       fast helicopters     airwolf       and super fast motorcycles     street hawk       and viewers have eaten it up in the past    so   why not crimefighters with jet powered roller blades    to be honest   as a made for tv presentation   blade squad is at least watchable    the film has a relatively large cast of characters   a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script   and enough action sequences to keep one half interested    i d imagine adolescent males   probably the target audience of this turkey   would get a kick out of it    i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad    i can remember liking   airwolf   and   street hawk   when i was 1-1 or 11    and   although this isn t saying much   blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on   the insipidly awful generation x   a huge disappointment considering the comic book s terrific two year beginning      but   i digress    despite its limited appeal   blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series    one   it suffers from mtv syndrome   a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer s senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background    oh yeah   dylan s   knockin  on heaven s door   and bowie s   i m afraid of americans   are used here   in rather poor taste    two   blade squad needs a new crew for the sound    the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end    characters  dialogue   at times   sounded choppy and unintelligible    during one important scene   a song played loudly in the background    when a character spoke   the song s volume dropped but did not disappear    as soon as that character finished speaking   the song s volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke    this sounds trivial   i m sure   but it distracted me immensely    finally   this is commercial television    foul language is not allowed   typically   on commercial television    thus   don t use foul language in a made for tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner    in an early scene of the film   for example   the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets    when the good guy spouts out a bad word   a driver conveniently honks his car s horn off screen to muffle the word out    in a   seinfeld   episode   this technique proved funny   here   it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably    perhaps future writers   if a show is spun out of the movie   could take a cue from marvel comics  2-199 series of comics    make up a bunch of new bad words for the future    this way   you don t need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language    compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies   blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp    when compared to   say   a movie studio film   blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials   bs       review written august 12   1998    ,-1
 what a contrast !  in the space of two days   i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly    i m not sure you could get two more different movies    while the former was all over the top   telegraphing everything   shoving its philosophy of life down our throats   hurlyburly was the complete op1ite   wound so tight and with so much buried in its script   one could spend weeks thinking about it    this is one interesting movie    it s very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of  98   in the company of men   although not quite so nasty    there s lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men    hurlyburly doens t contain much plot   we just follow eddie   sean penn   around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him    his big question is   does it all pertain to him    and if it does   how is he sup1ed to feel about it all       it   means everything   television   friends   events that happen    i guess it could be summed up more crudely as   what s it all about    this is not a movie for answers    donna   anna paquin   gives some but they re not really satisfying   they just lead to more questions    that s what makes this movie stay on your mind    these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time    even when we push them to the background   however we resolve these questions influences everything we do    the performances are all superb in hurlyburly    i haven t seen sean penn in much before   in fact   i can t remember seeing him in anything     but he is brilliant in this    eddie isn t a likeable character   but sean penn makes him understandable    i don t want to be his friend but i d like to help him    chazz palminteri is also great as phil   making him an awful person    i d never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend    everyone in this film nails their performances   making this world real    it s a nasty world   it s a sexist world    unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct   hurlyburly is a man s world   seen unapologetically through the eyes of men    i find this fascinating and on two counts   depressing    first   it s depressing that such a world exists    a large part of hurlyburly s success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood   that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world   toys   playthings    sure   everyone is background to everyone else but in this world   women are a long way in the background    second   these are the movies that are being made   stories about men s world    where are the stories about women s world    not the soap operas and the   chick flicks   that are meant to satisfy women   but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men    hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts    it s very talkative   intelligent and static    while this can make the film drag a bit   and people sometimes sound like they re quoting textbooks   mostly this is a good thing    not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas    not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience    all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen    it also means that you have to pay attention    ,-1
 capsule   the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith s films gets their own movie    the gags are sporadically funny    it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti gay jokes    the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team    the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film    sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching    this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night       and it turns out he had very good reasons         low -1    4 to +4    a film needs a plot    it needs characters for empathy value    it needs a story and an emotional center    if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are    kevin smith has now made two satisfying films   clerks and chasing amy    with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp    peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled    but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith s fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it    his remaining two films   mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience    jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes   penis jokes   flatulence jokes   film pastiches   and in jokes    how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call    for me   the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny    there was not enough cleverness or variety    it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay    penis jokes work only so many times    showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags    they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford   the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british 1t war films including dead of night   the lady vanishes   and passport to pimlico    jay and silent bob were originally sup1edly typical generation x stoners    as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts    in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads    jay and silent bob   played by jason mewes and kevin smith   are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks    this leaves them at loose ends    they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie    they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash    so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way    the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood  the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny    silent bob   being silent   can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his    this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have    jay has to be the comic    he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive    the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny    he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair    so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team    their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before  sometimes just minutes before    like dogma before it   but definitely not like chasing amy   this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie    certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving    they are excuses for gags   many of which still fall flat    it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content    the film does not offer much to an adult audience    i rate it 4 on the -1 to 1-1 scale and a low -1 on the  4 to +4 scale    ,-1
 the previews for the movie are pretty good    they show a little plot   all the characters   and the emotional highlights   all spliced together to give a general impression of the script    unfortunately   the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes    the residents of mystery love hockey    mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football    the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who s guilty of shooting another man   yes   that s one of the movie s jokes      every saturday   the best players pair off for a game   and the whole town comes to watch    the town s prodigal son charlie   hank azaria   wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated    mystery s national fame has the town abuzz    a week later   charlie actually shows up in person   and he brings with him an offer from the nhl    the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals    the mysterians see this as both good and bad    on the one hand   they d love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition    on the other hand   they don t want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes    the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the pro1ition    biebe   russell crowe   has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys   including his new replacement    he s already resentful   and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife    crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film   so he s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding    charlie   meanwhile   is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man s worth    his   gift   of the feature story   and of the new york rangers   was his way of compensating for not being a better skater    he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit   but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him    burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter   the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans    walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey   but he actively tries to put it behind him    he wants his son to take the game more seriously   but he wants his community to just get over it    reynolds could have been good   but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner   and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together    one character actually was interesting    biebe s wife   mary mccormack     like the judge   understood that there was more to life than hockey    but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community    she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open    her unique insight is verbalized once   and it lasts only a scene before it is gone   but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom    mysterty   alaska follows a handful of other characters   but none are well developed or worth mentioning    the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story   no underlying thing that the movie is really about    instead   roach and screenwriters david e   kelley and sean o byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy    they try to make you laugh and cry   to feel outrage and pride    they present the framing and cadence for jokes   but there s nothing truly funny    they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness   but they give you nothing to be really sad about    as columnist molly ivins would say   it s all hat   no cattle    the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about    there is a funeral scene   played with appropriate gravity and somber music    it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what s truly important    russell crowe steps forward to speak   about to spell out the movie s metaphor for us    he says that what really matters in life is   community            then adds   and hockey      i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear    only mildly bad   mystery   alaska probably deserves 2 stars    i even laughed out loud   genuine laughs in places    but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers   a friend of roach   turned up in a role that didn t suit him    myers is a comic character actor    he puts on masks   becomes an outrageous caricature   and is funny    he s great as austin powers   dr   evil   or any of his scottish characters    nobody else in mysterty   alaska is a comic caricature    all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi serious roles    for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast   toward his audience   and indeed toward the film itself    it s an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously    ,-1
 a suave   cool   collected   rich   uptight bad guy = cliche    a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche    a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche    a crooked   chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche    at an intense moment   our main character tries to get away   but the car has trouble starting = cliche    complaining about cliches = cliche    ok   ok    so we always hear about cliches    but if there was ever to be a prime example   the real mccoy is it !  not one uttered word   not one frame of film   not one character in this whole movie isn t a cut and paste example of everything we ve ever seen    they might as well use this as a training film     how to make a bank robbery film in the 9-1 s      karen mccoy   kim basinger   is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six year stay at the state prison    she wants to make things right and go straight   especially with the fact that she has a six year old son out there who doesn t even know she s alive    aware of mccoy s bank robbing expertise   sniveling bad guy jack schmidt   terence stamp   uses the same six year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past    he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier   which   by the way   is somehow due to schmidt    and if she refuses    who knows what he ll do to the kid       cue sinister laughter    this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it s hard to know where to begin    the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant    i can t stress enough how every single element   whether it be a character   the dialogue   a plot   twist     etc     is so damn generic that you ll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes   let alone in front of the camera    basinger is absolutely vacant    and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her    here s someone that spent their time robbing banks   and now as she heads onto the street   we re sup1ed to feel sorry for her    as she confronts her son   who doesn t even know who she is   are we sup1ed to break into tears      especially when neither basinger nor zach english   who plays the kid   has any depth or emotional radiance whatsoever    i sup1e i should mention val kilmer    yeah   that s right   he s in it !  quite sadly too   seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name    and he got second billing !  to be fair   i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j   t    barker    unfortunately the script doesn t allow much room for improvement   and when his character is used like bookends   he never shows up in the middle of the film !      we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project    the real mccoy just can t keep it s head above water   and soon   * very * soon   sinks into a cliched mess of movie    the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer   and the dialogue   particularly schmidt s trite dialogue   falls like the niagra    this is definitely one to avoid   folks    the real mccoy is anything but !  ,-1
 ironically   one of the themes of 2-1-1 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life    unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest   because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes   watching this sad excuse for a movie    actually smoking 2-1-1 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn t be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie    not only is it a pathetically bad film overall   but 2-1-1 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever    the plot is scattered   thin and predictable   the acting is monumentally bad   and the style of film making resembles a home video    it is december 31   1981 and the big party is at monica s   martha plimpton   house    but no one has arrived yet    her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups    some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica   and some are total strangers    but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night s end    those who are invited are the ones that have the issues    it is up to those who aren t to help them come to terms    first there is eric   brian mccardie   who is a former boyfriend of monica s and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance   or lack thereof    he is one of the most bland characters   in a film full of dullness   because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical   a common trait of this poor production    bridget   nicole parker   and caitlyn   angela featherstone   who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year s eve and tag along to the party with them    they stumble across a nameless bartender   ben affleck   who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections    he is nether sexually deprived   nor uncertain about his future   as he is in law school    his lack of flaws is both boring   unrealistic and painful to watch    as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub standard comedy    moving on   there is val   christina ricci   and stephie     gabby hoffman   2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts    val is monica s cousin and a true fan of the new york scene    on the other hand   stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can t find    paradoxically   it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar   actually they attempt to flee from their presence   but aren t successful   who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds    of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples   only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot    wisely   the movie s creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy   courtney love   and kevin   paul rudd   who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless    paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie   janeane garofalo   and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship    however   the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends   and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening    finally   there are the two worst performances and worst sub plot of the film    jack   jay mohr   and cindy   kate hudson   have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy s virginity the night before    while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self   he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy    very often   when a film is as putrid as this production   there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory    however   this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted    instead   what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts   bad continuity and inaccuracies    first   and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another   there is no apparent order that it follows   and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot    at other times   objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot    there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish    not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver    and yet   no matter how miserable this film may be   and no matter how poor the acting is all around   there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots    perhaps   if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or   perhaps   even three   there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development   or quality acting   or even a decent plot payoff at the end    but it didn t happen that way    the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance   and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight    ,-1
 199-1s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood   two movies dealing with the same subject   or   to be precise   same   high concept      in summer 1994   that   high concept   was   mad bomber action thriller      in few weeks     thrillride of the summer   actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away   so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes    the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland   where gaerity   tommy lee jones     ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material   escapes from prison    he comes to boston   where he accidentally notices jimmy dove   jeff bridges     dedicated bomb dis1al expert within boston police    few people except gaerity know the dove s violent past   when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence   betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good pur1e    gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror   directed specifically at dove s colleagues   friends and relatives    dove   who is just going to retire and start family   now must confront the mad bomber    while speed doesn t even try to bother with plot and characters   using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes   blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story    and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed    badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all    screenplay by john bateer and john rice   barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland   using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama    the plot is   of course   full of implausibilities    the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual   no matter how brilliant he is   can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay    those questions   same as in the case of speed   could be forgotten while the action goes on   but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters    because of them   movie seems a little bit too long   and boring at times    the most annoying element of the film   however   is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber    his acting is so over the top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself    this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive    the film have few bright points   though    some of the action scenes are fine   which should be credited to director stephen hopkins   predator ii   judgement night      and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove s colleague    but   all in all   blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous   yet hardly unforgettable competitor    ,-1
 don t get me wrong    i tend to appreciate besson s naive   unashamedly romantic worldview   an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood    his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving   thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman   and 1997 s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love   l u v   that s even more of a hoot on repeated viewings    but his joan of arc is a mess   despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself    jovovich   besson s own personal muse through the making of his last two films   though they ve since separated     is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan   as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior   but also a fabulous   supermodel level babe      and besson remains a servicable action film director   though not an especially facile one    leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english   joan s struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring   and besson helps you understand how the french could believe   fervently   that god is on her side    besson s big mistake   i think   is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject    yes   joan had visions    but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue eyed christ figure on display in besson s hallucinatory dream sequences    the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman   billed as   the conscience     shows up   spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell   babbling like ally mcbeal    that s kind of a shame   since she does quite well up to that point   charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness    that darkly attractive aspect of her character    that she s as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord    is more or less betrayed by the final reels   in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she s overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who s about to take a fall    as the story winds down   with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire   besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance    trouble is   he s chosen a lurid   often jokey tone for the balance of the picture    including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes    and it s im1sible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is   to a great extent   nothing more than a put on    this glib   pre fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer s the passion of joan of arc   1928     a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan s trial   and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema    compared to that film   the messenger plays as a crime against history                                                                   directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france/usa   1999  theatrical aspect ratio   2   35   1                                                                 ,-1

 it s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise    the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying    osmosis jones is crude   gross   disgusting   and was directed by the farrelly brothers   the twisted siblings behind there s something about mary   me   myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt    not that there s anything wrong with scatology    i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor   such as it was    it s merely that with osmosis jones   the farrellys humor is too juvenile   too predictable    you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn    osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho    the trouble is   the animation may please the very young   but the jokes may be over their heads   while the teen age audience may find it too tame for their tastes    adults   well   let s just say most will find it unappetizing    osmosis jones plays like a 1-1-1 minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby    the live action sequences revolve around frank   bill murray     who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe    he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower    frank   much to the consternation of his daughter   is a fast food addict   eating anything   and everything   that can kill you    he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner   and presumably smell better   than he does    frank s body is invaded by thrax   a lethal virus   after frank eats a hard boiled egg that had fallen to the ground    it s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth    nope   the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg   wresting it from the primate s mouth    like i said   the gross meter tips the scales on this one    after ingesting the egg   the movie begins its animated sequences    here   osmosis jones   voiced by chris rock     a re-1ade white blood cell is teamed with drix   voiced by frasier s david hyde pierce     a 12 hour   painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax   smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne      basically   what we have is a cliched cop buddy movie   rife with all the clich   s of that genre    and this is why osmosis jones doesn t click    it merely falls back on tired   familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations    the jokes and puns are lame   osmosis searches out a snitch   a former flu virus    after pumping him for information   drix tells osmosis     funny   he doesn t look fluish      and the jokes don t rise above that level    the live action scenes are no better    frank is such a slob   so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child    he s almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters    osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left    the animation is rather two dimensional and flat    it lacks scope and depth    it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head   and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater    ,-1
 has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs    in enemy of the state   that is exactly right    a few parts the net   and a few parts conspiracy theory   enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997 s lame brained men in black    will this guy ever get a real role    he has the bruce willis syndrome    the plot is bascially smith   playing a lawyer   getting into hot water with some high government murderers   who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie   when a tape of the killing gets into his hands    he inlists the help of an old conspirator   hackman     and   at the end   er       you  know    enemy was one of the worst films of last year    not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight   the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven   and i didn t like how smith always magically out smarted the badies when all the other extra characters   seeming more intelligent than smith   somehow got run over by a truck    enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek   insurrection    i know these two films are different in   well   everything   but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me    somehow   quality can t overshadow quantity    ,-1
 vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family    as with the other three films   their two children   rusty and audrey   are played by a revolving series of actors    this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles    also back   is cousin eddie   randy quaid     the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes    in vegas vacation clark griswold   chase   decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen   d angelo   can renew their wedding vows    it is at this point when comedy is sup1ed to ensue    apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn t bother to write any jokes into the script    at least that s the way it looks when watching this turkey    about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film   since there had been none up to that point    by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times   and i had smiled at a couple of gags    i might add that none of the funny   and i use the term loosely   moments came as a result of anything chase   d angelo or quaid were involved in    they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film    the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids   who manage to have a couple of their own adventures    rusty becomes a vegas high roller   providing most of the film s best moments    every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag   it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film    which brings me to the best moment of the film    the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road   the theme from the original vacation   begins to play    christie brinkley and her red ferrari   also from the first movie   drive by    it was a cute moment   but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been   and just how far that this series has fallen    too bad    ,-1
 burnt money is the perfect festival film    it will show once or twice   and then no one   thankfully   will ever have to hear from it again    this film from the seattle international film festival 2-1-11 s emerging masters series is easily one of the year s worst    billed as a gay `bonnie and clyde    this gritty film from director marcelo pi   eyro has its only highlight in a well designed title sequence    two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader   whose plan they screwed up   angry    this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys   one of whom may not actually be gay    hiding out in a prostitute s apartment   the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie s conclusion    if caught   they risk losing all the money   and their love    as an added emotional bonus   one of the gay men is dying    or something like that    everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost    clarity isn t exactly this movie s striving virtue   so it was a little hard to pick up    not much could have really happened though    the main events in this long two hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex   graphic drug use   extreme violence   and strong language    lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there s a reason   but there s no pur1e to anything in this film    most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly   while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing    it appears pi   eyro   who co wrote with marcelo figueras   from a novel by ricardo piglia   pur1efully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement    he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as 1sible   makes them snort cocaine   gives them guns and condoms   and lets them go    burnt money is pointless    the performances are bad    it tries to thrill and shock   but only causes boredom    god forbid it will ever get a distributor    another disappointing film from this year s so called emerging masters series    pass on by    ,-1
 claire danes   giovanni ribisi   and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists   but they re just about the only palatable element of the mod squad   a lame brained big screen version of the 7-1s tv show    the story has all the originality of a block of wood   well   it would if you could decipher it     the characters are all blank slates   and scott silver s perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come    by sheer force of talent   the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they re on screen   but the mod squad is just a second rate action picture with a first rate cast    ,-1
 the haunting   a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film   to scare us    if you ve ever seen a movie   which you probably have considering you are on this website   you should know about all of the trivia they 1t before a movie    they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film    but   the one i always like are the &quot   other name&quot   joke that try and rename a particular film    for instance   the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film   small soldiers    they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size    well   after seeing the haunting   i had a few particular names for it as well    unfortunately   i can only 1t one of them   otherwise   i d be getting some pretty angry e mails from overprotective mothers    that title would be the confusing    ok   that is a pretty bad title   but it fits this film perfectly    it basically serves up no pur1e   and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot   it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb    liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth   but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth    the haunting is nothing but trash   but unfortunately   will still make a boatload of money    before i rant and rave about how bad this film is   let me point out the few   and i stress the word few   bright spots in this film    first   the house is great  looking    it looks beautiful   but this is also a dark spot    it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it    this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film    things look so great   that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight    haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie    the hill house is not eerie    it is beautiful   but not the least bit frightening    ever heard of lili taylor    before this film i did not   but i am glad that i do now    she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film    despite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept   she manages to light up the screen every time she appears   but unfortunately   her co stars are usually following right behind    owen wilson   who plays luke   is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance   other then taylor    he is basically there for the comic relief   and his character development is poor in all other areas    all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped    wilson had potential as luke   but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs    liam neeson and catherine zeta jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film    their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot    they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting s coffin    the plot is terrible    the opening scene of the film is very important   but the director makes it too obvious by getting close ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film    as i sat through the film   i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish    nell   lili taylor s character   goes from the hunted to the savior    it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film    he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in depth information    for instance   the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program    but   we get zilch for the other four    plus   two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes    and the worst part   most horror films have killings    for some reason   they kill off luke at the end of the film    no reason whatsoever   just off with his head   literally    overall   the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie    bad plot   confusing storyline and a waste of good talent    hopefully   liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential    hopefully   lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film    and hopefully   other horror films   such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house   will not be as bad as this one    ,-1
 in 1989   director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama     glory     but since then   he has made continuous disappointments   to me at least   with 1994 s   legends of the fall     and 1996 s   courage under fire      those two films weren t bad   just not very good   but with zwick s latest film     the siege     he has finally made one       the siege     is a modern day action thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city    investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard   denzel washington   and frank haddad   tony shalhoub     who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it    later   a bomb goes off in a broadway theater   killing even more    they soon meet cia operative elise kraft   annette bening     who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist    there are some movies that simply don t need to be made   and     the siege   may very well be one of them    oh   sure   zwick thinks he is making a   meaningful   action film   since he has added lots of ex1ition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism   but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than   say     die hard     which also starred bruce willis    this time   willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u   s   army   who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax    whatever points     the siege     earnestly tried to make   were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen   or maybe   zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place    the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical   just as women were in the recent     john caprenter s vampires     by placing them all in the category of   bad guys         the siege     contains three fine actors   washington   bening   and shalhoub   but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development    bening has slightly more to do   and has an intriguing character to work with   while shalhoub pretty much steals the show   even though   again   he has no real character    by the climax of     the siege     with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so called   message   of the story   i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to     on deadly ground     in which steven seagal gave a 1-1 minute speech at the end about preserving the environment       the siege   is constantly heavy handed   not entertaining or insightful   and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay    ,-1
 i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad   there would be broken furniture   traces of smack and cocaine on the floor   and a dead prostitute in the bathroom    i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad   there might be the same elements present    coincidence    poor kyle   a meek looking jon favreau         he is about to marry his radiant fiancee   laura   cameron diaz      but before he exchanges his vows   he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout    but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could 1sibly get    the prostitute has met a horrible   though accidental death   and drugs are everywhere    the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time    a surprisingly calm robert boyd   christian slater     who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions   ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she ll never be found    although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body   which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases     when they return from their trip   guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends    one is adam   daniel stern   he grows increasingly agitated    whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way   his blood pressure increases    or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family    another is michael   who was actually responsible for her death    he tries to bury his feelings   but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well    boyd is the   doer  of the group    seemingly suffering from a long psychosis   when he feels as if his secret is about to be ex1ed   he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks    kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to laura s demanding expectations    then   there s moore   leland orser   who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face    the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy   but it presents things in a manner that just aren t funny    drugs   mutilation   and killing your own friends isn t something to be laughed at    as a straight psychological drama   i could see how it might have worked   as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes sick ways    but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours    if you do like this movie   i don t think that i want to know you    i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the   smart play      and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding needing fiancee    but her talents are essentially wasted here    it s obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone    but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless    do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film    ,-1
 i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year   when matthew perry had just signed on    i m big fan of perry s subtle sense of humor   and in addition   i think chris farley s on edge   extreme acting was a riot    so naturally   when the trailer for   almost heroes   hit theaters   i almost jumped up and down    a soda in hand   the lights dimming   i was ready to be blown away by farley s final starring role and what was sup1ed to be matthew perry s big breakthrough    i was ready to be just amazed   for this to be among farley s best   in spite of david spade s absence    i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran    sadly   none of this came to pass    the humor is spotty at best   with good moments and laughable one liners few and far between    perry and farley have no chemistry   the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade   for it s his type of humor   and not at all what perry is associated with    and the movie tries to be smart   a subject best left alone when it s a farley flick    the movie is a major dissapointment   with only a few scenes worth a first look   let alone a second    perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie   and not surprisingly   the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley    and farley s classic humor is widespread   too    almost heroes almost works   but misses the wagon train by quite a longshot    guys   let s leave the exploring to lewis and clark   huh    stick to   tommy boy     and we ll all be   friends      ,-1
 the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride   and it s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics   both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year s finest films    so   naturally   when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found   this notion left me puzzled    it is a rare thing for a children s movie to be praised this highly   so wouldn t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this sup1edly   magical   piece of work    a tad bewildered   but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films   i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind   having great expectations for the film    looking back   i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater    believe me   i wanted to like babe   pig in the city    the plot seemed interesting enough   after the events that took place in the original   babe the sheep pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon    but after a fateful encounter with a water well   arthur hogget   james cromwell   who the movie could have used alot more of   has been rendered bed ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially    the only solution that his wife   magda szubanski   going from delightfully charming to downright annoying   can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair   i think   and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank   set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public      problem is   the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded   city     a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion    setting the main plot in motion   mrs   hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals   despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels    it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters   the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright    here is where the film took a wrong turn    up until this point   i had being having a rather enjoyable experience    the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs   hogget is accused of smuggling drugs    unfortunately   the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel   none of them being even one tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe    the main topic of discussion surrounding babe   pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children   and i believe it is    at one point   a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown    at other times   we are treated to surrealistic flash backs to mrs   hogget s full cavity search at the airport    in fact   the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing    however   that is   as they say   neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway    the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half   let alone entertain a child    another problem i found with the film was it s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story    if you re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel   fine    it may not be my cup of tea   but at least it is a noble ambition    but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs   hogget swinging from wall to wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls    it just didn t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining   and the same goes for the rest of the movie    ,-1
 to put it bluntly   ed wood would have been proud of this    a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor   hokey drama   zero logic and a crap screenplay    also   a beautifully anti climactic ending    not to say it didn t look intriguing when i saw the previews    so much for truth in advertising    roland emmerich   who s later   independence day   would look like   the 4-1-1 blows   compared to this   co writed and directed this inane sci fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens    in a useless opening sequence   men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it    it wouldn t be till present day    94   till they would actually figure it out    they re decipherer    a slightly neurotic scientist   nice twist     dr   dan jackson   james spader   doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare   who s life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word    why do they use him to decipher what no one else could    so there is a hokey ending !  duh !  he figures it out in about a minute    yea    and then they get a suicidal colonel or something     jack   o neill   kurt russel   with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat top that would make howie long snap into a fetal 1ition      why a suicidal colonel    for the ending !  you ll get the hang of this    they open the stargate   a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad    after an overdone special effects thing   they re       inside a goddam pyramid    so they went to egypt   right    wrong    they re on another planet that was filmed in egypt    they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra   the sun god   the androginous jaye davidson   with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma     and there are fights   explosions and a kiss between two people    yea    also melodrama   stupidity   hokey scenes and a bizarre language    an anti climactic ending ends with stupid lines     say hello to king tut   asswhole !      the quintessential line   lemme tell ya   and some convenient pesudo pseudo pseudo character development    by the end   you just wanna go home and watch   i don t know   the   outer limits   or something    the script s terrible    the special effects are okay   but nothing great    the story s so weak that it s almost opaque    the whole experience just isn t worth it unless you re so bored that you d consider watching a   full house   marathon       or  this    i d pick this   obviously   but still   it s just not fun at all    and i can t wait for it to premier on mst3k    ,-1
 i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick    take the professional   for example    it boasts extremely glossy cinematography   a couple of recognizable name actors   and a couple of fairly impressive explosions    it s also basically about violence and cheap titilation   and features a central relationship between a middle aged man and a twelve year old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension    the professional is all over the map   and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant    the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon   jean reno     brutally efficient but also very isolated    one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door    her name is matilda   natalie portman     and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d   e   a    agent norman stansfield   gary oldman   after matilda s father tried to rip him off    leon reluctantly takes matilda in   then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother    the two become closer   which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much   and sets out to eliminate them both    writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita   a slick potboiler about a female assassin    there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film   with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast   he has created a film chock full of moody close ups and evocative lighting    but beneath the shiny wrapper   there isn t nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe    the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop    leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits   all intended to show us that for a hired killer   he s really not so bad a guy   he drinks lots of milk   takes meticulous care of a potted plant   and enjoys gene kelly movies    jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality   but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda    natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality   but she doesn t have too much to work with   either    besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life   and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing    a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place   as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover   character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag    gary oldman s entire part is something of a cheap gag   wild eyed and way over the top   but at least he is interesting to watch    there isn t a real person to be found anywhere in the professional   which isn t always a problem in an action thriller   except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more    a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve year old in a really distasteful way    there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda s relationship   confront it head on   or ignore it entirely    but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he s going to show them a forbidden love story   while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman s rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing    this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol   or the blood which is spilled aplenty    a great deal of the time   the professional is just plain sleazy   and all the soft filters in the world can t disguise that fact    ,-1
 one of these days   i ll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie    king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding   and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single   emotive viewing     his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art house trappings    it s a perfume drenched   coke addled visit to the seedy pornography shop   where beautiful models   no   hookers    no   courtesans   usher you through the silk curtains    ferrara s only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again   since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he s onscreen    his 8 minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal   unwatchable   and pretentious failure    when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements   or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch   there s a much needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair    you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they re actually having fun    the addiction is that movie    walken   sadly   does not appear in the blackout    the central role of matty   a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction   is played by matthew modine   who takes what he can get after cutthroat island      much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni s terminally bored cultural elite   matty is involved in a bitter pill   relationship   with high fashioned model annie   at least i think she s a model      matty s lady is played by french actress b   atrice dalle   arrested twice for cocaine 1session during filming of the blackout    not that you needed to know that   but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara s entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout    no kidding    requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara s movies and his controversial urban lifestyle    matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him    no doubt   he was off chasing the dragon    in his despair   matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery   tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne   dennis hopper   in full   dirty ol  man   mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs    wider !    toward the end of the night   they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie   sarah lassez     start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene   then matty thankfully blacks out    something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie   and it s exactly what you think it was    suffice to say   there s some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two   or anyone at all    the blackout is typical ferrara   no plot to speak of   plenty of raunch   and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see through curtain in his hotel room by the sea   by the sea   by the beautiful sea    cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu style sleaze   and we re back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits       yeah ! ! !  yeah ! ! !  arrrghhh !    says mr   hopper    dirty old sod      it s compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way   leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny    how s that for cryptic    never fear    ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he s all about    i can picture it now       take off yer clothes   kid    it s essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist   and you re his visual id    you re the soul   the heart   the bloodstream of the picture    take it off !  take it all off ! ! !  ha ha ha !    friggin  vampire    yeah   you   ferrara    a final word about matthew modine   he s actually a fine actor when properly cast   but there s something too squeaky clean in his demeanor    he s ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations   such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time bomb nebbish in short cuts   who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene   though no one seems to notice him      [he was in that scene     ed   ]  here   he s asked to let it all hang out   sporting a three day stubble and oily bangs    he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski   but it s somehow lacking    modine lacks the feral intensity of brando   entirely miscast in ferrara s flesh fair    better luck next time   matt    someday   you ll be forgiven for cutthroat island   which wasn t really your fault in the first place    maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere   and all will once again be well in your world    ,-1
 making your first feature film ain t easy    assemble a decent   if not   strong cast   as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king   and you re already ahead of the game    but rehash old plot lines   tired dialogue   and standard clich   s   and a well intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film    how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse    the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another   but here we have it    again    five irish kids in nyc s hell s kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop    with teary music    and slow motion    in the film s first scene    the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults   unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen    leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante    i d like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah   blah   blah   but all we seem to get are little tastes of 1sible plot points    he s concerned about buddy jason gedrick s heroin abuse    he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin s character s sister    he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic looking counterfeit cash ever made   a genuinely funny touch      but none of this ever really amounts to anything    it seems that moresco s greater concern is to provide that intangible   slice of life     that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone s been trying to evoke since scorsese s early work    so   we get the drunk guys   hugging and singing together at the local bar   to prove to us that they really love each other       do people actually do this !      we get a lot of tough street talk    usually mumbled for effect    and a whole lot of the f word   whether it sounds like it fits or not    we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack pur1e    bruno kirby   chazz palminteri   you know   guys you ve seen in movies just like this one before    assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears   and baldwin s performance is adequate   but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it s almost funny    moresco   a theater guy and sometimes tv writer   including the series falcone     obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child   but the content is probably too personal    as a result   the movie s style is heavy handed   in need of a considerable amount of toning down    nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids   moresco reminds us    boy does he remind us    with slow dissolves to the earlier scene   running in slow motion   complete with dialogue from the present   just in case we don t comprehend the link to the past    moresco needs to either trust his audience s intelligence   or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it    his next project should have a little more personal distance   and a lot more subtlety    if he actually gets that chance    reviewed as part of our 2-1-11 boston film festival coverage   feature story coming soon      ,-1
 whenever u   s   government starts meddling into other countries  affairs   under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political   religious or ethnic persecution   the other side is ready to use mantra that says   look who s talking !  what have you done to the indians      however   even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their pur1es    hollywood is just another example   with its revisionist westerns   made in early 199-1s    those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness   coinciding with the 5-1-1th anniversary of columbus  discovery of america    one of such examples is geronimo   an american legend   1993 western directed by walter hill   film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers    the hero of the film is geronimo   played by wes studi     leader of apaches   fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century    when the movie begins   in 1885   geronimo and his apaches made peace with u   s   government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation    however   broken promises   injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless    with not more 3-1 or so of his followers   he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign    general crook   gene hackman     commander of u   s   army forces   respects geronimo and knows that even his 5   -1-1-1 force isn t enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest    instead   he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches   lt   charles gatewood   jason patric   and indian hunter al sieber   robert duvall      together with young lt   britton davis   matt damon   they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo    geronimo   an american legend   like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness   try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities   but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors    so   the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies    almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people    although such elements of john millius  screenplay do indeed have some basis in history   they harm the story of geronimo    to be honest   walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film   but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time    instead   they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band    to make even worse   hill has some real problems with pacing and style   and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one   story about geronimo and story about his pursuers    the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo s life before and after his last uprising   in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood    the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting    wes studi   cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans   was perfect choice for geronimo   not only because he resembles geronimo   but because he induces a lot of passion in his role    contrary to him   we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies    while this could be expected from someone like jason patric   it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall    even hill s directing is bellow expectations   battle scenes are too short and   like in many of his late films   force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 197-1s    even his old associate   music com1er ry cooder   disappoints   with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic    on the other hand   photography by lloyd ahern ii   with the use of red lenses   gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere   ideal for this movie that was sup1ed to be melancholic epic    all in all   compared with some of the hollywood s examples of political correctness   this film isn t so bad   but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better    ,-1

    easely one of the worst films of the year        with the millenium just around the corner   hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century    this time it is arnold schwartze-1ger against the powers of evil    the result is somewhat predictable    i didn t have high hopes about arnold s   much anticipated   return to the big screen    schwarze-1ger fans will probably be pleased   action lovers won t be bored   and the catholic league will be angry    everyone else will see  end of days  for what it is   a deliciously bad motion picture    think of it as hollywood s own y2k bug    did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you ll get 999   as in 1999    yes   you better believe it     satan is here on earth   working on his latest project    the end of days    this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and   although not al pacino   he is fun to behold    he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker   wreaking   as they say   havoc    the way it works is he smirks and something explodes    before the stroke of the new millennium he s got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations    only schwarze-1ger s cop attached to an anti terrorist unit can stop him    films like this has one serious weakness    logic    no matter how you twist the   plot     you ll find it incredibly stupid   even for a schwartze-1ger movie !      the incredible fact is that such directors never learn    after thousands of headless productions   this theme has become one big clich      here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution    he is walking around n   y     blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius    all he wants is the girl   that is somehow special    but schwartze-1ger is more clever than he looks   he has hidden her in a church   where satan dare not enter    so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information     you can have your wife and daughter back     i  can give you happiness that you can only dream of     just  give me the address        indeed with a script like that   you could make a wonderful parody   but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously   attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller    and for you who have awaited arnold swartze-1ger s comeback   will not be very satisfied    we ve not seen him in a while    that s because he didn t have a worthy opponent    he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars    he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop    so   after all those fights   what s left for arnold schwarze-1ger    how about satan    in my opinion   he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron s   terminator      and that is schwartze-1ger s strength    muscles and no emotions    here he tries to achieve an artistic level   moving towards the oscar    this is called   an adult turn   if successful and   a flop   if unsuccessful    make a wild guess !  his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems    this requires at least some acting skills    regrettably   the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles    the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters    the movie is otherwise technically impressive   with a solid cinematography and fine lighting    but the movie doesn t serve neither as a serious thriller   because of its stupidity   nor as comic entertainment   because of its serious tone      the only real comic relief in this film is when swartze-1ger tries to cry    the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular    so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody    unless you are a die hard schwartze-1ger fan   stay away    as for schwarze-1ger   he ll be back    ,-1
 these days   people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run    197-1s nostalgia is already wearing off   and now   people are becoming more and more interested in 198-1s    few years in the future   early 199-1s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia    however   i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period    one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon s loaded weapon 1   that   in many ways   symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry   lack of originality and ideas    being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series   this film pairs two l   a   policemen   jack colt   emilio estevez     burn out alcoholic cop on the edge   and wes luger   samuel l   jackson     by the book policeman   days away from retirement    two of them   following the murder of luger s ex  partner   must confront evil general mortars   william shatner     crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies    the authors of this films   whose director   gene quintano   worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy   lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects   and that reflects in the lack plot   characters   and   even original lines    the plot   or what goes for the plot in this movie   is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years   apart from lethal weapon series   this film   borrows   its female lead from basic instinct      the best gags   are   same as with many other similar movies   shown in the trailers    the rest simply doesn t work    only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh    others would probably wince at the lameness of humour    some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while    but   at the end   spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort    the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones    the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel    ,-1
 paul verhoeven   the dutch auteur who dragged his violent   sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film   has never been what i d consider a thoughtful director   though some of his films   notably starship troopers   have been lauded as artistic achievements     but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who s managed to   no matter what the budget   make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils    starship troopers was essentially a b monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange   a great film that s nearly im1sible to find on video   yet showgirls is everywhere     in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins   the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards   who may actually be 45% silicone     in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage    it s not a completely successful film   but as a failure it s certainly an interesting   and mostly entertaining   one    my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores   spetters   a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange   haven t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight      i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop   a bleak super hero satire with a robotic hero that s as touching as schwarze-1ger s in t2    that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics    its violence seemed to be there for a pur1e   namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread   not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience    there s a jaw dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him    he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim s every fearful tic    it s a startling moment of barbaric   maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk noir    in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won t shut up   he impales a co worker   drowns another and so on    but why    his character is introduced as a smug genius   the kind who s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear   sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place   though once the character becomes invisible   this film has him pull a 18-1 shift into a psychotic movie monster    the kind who just won t die    hollow man s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda   elizabeth shue   acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm   and her lover   a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who s saddled with the film s worst lines     i ve lost cohesion again !        they re a typical aaron spelling couple   good looking but as vacant as george w   bush s republican national convention speech   i   e    bush referring to clinton           so much promise       but to what end    to what end         this actually got applause !  suddenly warren beatty doesn t look so absurd      the rest of the film s characters are all well past thirty   though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one liners   is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood s new character developing technique    ahh   what a cynical time we live in        as the picture opens we meet cain   kevin bacon     an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret   so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation s   project with the goal to make invisibility a 1sibility   for what pur1e is never hinted at      they ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine   in a twist worthy of the film s 195-1 s late show origins   to impulsively experiment on himself    caine -1lects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead    our mad scientist is turned invisible   after several fx heavy complications     then he inexplicably   it s hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures   but this is never explored   and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human      begins raping   assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases   always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger    it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it s verhoeven s films that have become hollow    like the rest   this one is cold   heartless   and full of contempt for humanity   but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit   insight and makes no statement other than   audiences will pay for anything these days      it s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level   or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun   thrill a minute ride    verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care    the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick    how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self    a couple weeks ago   after seeing the trailer   a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability    hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa   in a serious manner to boot    but oh yeah   it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway    verhoeven delivers the sleazy   goods     but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner   here it just feels icky and uncomfortable    the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses   caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux psycho music strains in the background    it s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn t exploring voyeurism   like in the classic peeping tom   but exploiting it and not even doing that very well    it s funny that with all the technology $9-1 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand    most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks    in fact it s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since   by the end   most of his potential victims don infer red glasses that track his body heat    as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov   a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre     and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked    the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy    it happens when a lab assistant   kim dickens   who looks like she stepped out of playboy   in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon   suddenly pauses       are you looking at me       she queries   obviously haunted    it s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982   the apex of the mad slasher craze      those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer    and they re the only reason to check out hollow man   preferably as a mid week bargain rental    you ve been warned    but you probably won t listen   will you    tis  a pity        ,-1
 fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 198-1s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade    tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies   but the quantity    most of those movies were produced by cannon group   company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus    those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman   b  movie mentors of future hollywood legends    unfortunately   that didn t happened   and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade   behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage   that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal    sadly for bronson   that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 197-1s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead   and lowering his own reputation in process    on the other hand   bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular   especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself    one of such movies that seriously marred bronson s reputation is death wish 3   third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974    in the original movie   bronson played paul kersey   mild mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence    that movie was far from masterpiece   yet   in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time   on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry      unfortunately   six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels   even the presence of its original director didn t stop the rapid decline of the quality    death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend   living in the urban wasteland of east new york   populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out    before the reunion   kersey s friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker   played by gavan o herlihy   probably the only noteworthy role in the film      kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade   while the police inspector shriker   ed lauter     ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime    bronson   the main asset in this movie   plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine    although bronson s charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities   single man in his 6-1s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower     the lack of emotions or bronson s own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film    the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness   so they added romantic interest for their hero   public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey s crusade    on the other hand   emotions are much better played by confronting law abiding   yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks   ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks   and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey    unfortunately   michael winner doesn t know how to work out the plot   and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations   ends this movie with a bang    the big showdown at the end   that turns east new york into the sarajevo like battle zone   is probably the worst part of the movie   because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget    in short   this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 198-1s nostalgia       special note for trekkies   marina sirtis   the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek   the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife      ,-1
 overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name   based on shirley jackson s novel   the haunting of hill house     stars lili taylor as one of three   lab rats   that participate in a sup1ed   insomnia   study being initiated by liam neeson    he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it    he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of   creepy   cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience s patience    i know this question has been 1ed before   but why do people keep remaking good movies    the original was a great psychological horror film    this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary    in fact   i feel it is downright im1sible to make a modern day pg 13 horror movie that is scary    unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening   then there s nothing in this film that will raise hackles    i nearly fell asleep twice during the film   and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn t seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed    it s sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly    owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house   and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability    catherine zeta jones   always nice to look at   is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs    liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what s going on as the rest of them do    finally   poor lili taylor   the center of the film   gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her    apparently   a subplot involving a tryst between zeta jones and taylor s characters was filmed but removed    that s too bad   because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative    this is jan de bont s second straight misfire   speed 2   cruise control being the first      when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better    robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that    one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset    if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything   it would have served to make the film terrifying    what our mind fashions on it s own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything    apparently   yet another version of this story is being filmed under it s original title    i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont s version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had    [pg 13]  ,-1
    tarzan and the lost city   is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while    not only it is poorly written   badly acted   and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas   it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid    unfortunately   it s not bad in the way great   colossal misfires like   heaven s gate     198-1   or   ishtar     1987   were bad    instead   it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with   which begs the question of why it was made in the first place    with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un produced   how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen    of course   tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history   he has appeared in over forty films   which have ranged from the very good   1984 s   greystoke   the legend of tarzan   lord of the apes     down to the really bad   1981 s   tarzan   the ape man   with bo derek      most of these films were just cheapie b movies made in the thirties and forties   starring ex olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps    therefore   if another tarzan movie is to be made   one might assume that it would have something new to offer   a different angle   an original storyline   anything to set it apart from all the others       greystoke   added a never before seen level of realism to the pulpy tale   and even   tarzan   the ape man   at least had the mis guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek s bare breasts       tarzan and the lost city     on the other hand   has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue    the script   by bayard johnson and j   anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come    comic books have better plots than this    the movie is so bad   in fact   that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer s comedy   george of the jungle      didn t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs    the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established   a quick opening narration tells of tarzan   casper van dien   being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes   and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage    when the movie starts in 1913   he is a civilized english gentleman   without an english accent     and he is to marry jane   jane march   in less than a week    however   when a wicked archeologist/grave robber named nigel ravens   steve waddington   begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar   one of africa s last great secrets   the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle    at first   jane refuses to go   pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding   but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down   therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape man    once the film gets going   in its own sluggish way     it delves into a series of jungle adventures   as tarzan   jane   and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city    most of the so called adventures are cheesy   predictable   and unexciting   with no pace   tension   or action to speak of    there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies   ranging from   raiders of the lost ark     1981   to   the goonies     1985      when the movie is running short on action   it includes a few greenpeace friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals   releasing a baby elephant from a trap   and throwing ivory tusks into the river    the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality    for instance   when tarzan   who was raised in the jungle   is bit by a cobra   he doesn t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi experienced weekend backpacker would do    instead   he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival    of course   one can t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is    not to ruin the ending or anything   but there is no lost city    there is   however   a lost pyramid   which i sup1e is all the resource strapped fx department could come up with   the special effects are not worthy of a made for tv movie      which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid   when it s sitting right out in the middle of an open field    strictly speaking     tarzan and the lost city   isn t even bad enough to have camp quality   although casper van dien s laughably stiff performance comes real close    this movie proves what   starship troopers   only hinted at   he cannot act   but he sure looks well groomed   even in the deepest heart of the african jungle    van dien is much too much of a pretty boy to be an effective tarzan   he s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth    i also wondered what the make up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa 1983 steve perry haircut    waddington makes a decent villain   although he s like a charmless version of belloq from   raiders of the lost ark     as jane   the ex model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan    she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two   but whenever a snake comes into the picture   she is reduced to a hysterical mess    however   amidst all this complaining   i do have one piece of good news       tarzan and the lost city   is so lacking in ideas both new and old   that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid    so   we can say this much for it   at least it had the decency to be short    ,-1
 everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here    wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence    billy zane is wooden as the hero    kristy swanson is given very little to do   and does very little with it    treat williams   looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse   is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie    only catherine zeta jones   as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance    she has energy and spunk   which the movie needed much more of    oh yeah   the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won t even care    about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones   and some colorful scenery    however   if youre looking for a fun family movie   go watch the underrated flipper    this is not a good movie    ,-1
 a life less ordinary   r   while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title   a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided   for this confused   confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle   producer andrew macdonald   and screenwriter john hodge    at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic  and   yes   ordinary  premise    after robert   boyle regular ewan mcgregor     an aspiring writer of trashy novels   is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation   he kidnaps naville s   ian holm   spoiled daughter celine   cameron diaz   and holds her for ransom    the joke here is that celine is a willing victim  her father threatened to cut her off financially   so she wants revenge  and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme   teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping        and   ultimately   didn t we see this one coming        love    so far   so mediocre    but mediocre is better than dreadful   which this film is   thanks in no small part to the hodge s contextual frame for the romance    it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth   so the chief of heaven s police   gabriel   dan hedaya   dispatches two angels   o reilly   holly hunter   and jackson   delroy lindo     to earth to hook up celine and robert  or lose their angel status    this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture    but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film   as it stands   it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand    not that there is much of a romance to begin with    try as diaz and mcgregor may   celine and robert are too one note to become very endearing characters    celine is rich bitch   robert is a dullard    as such   it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two  then again   they never seem to really connect with each other    when celine and robert start to overtly act on their   feelings     it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural    but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company s point was romance   honestly   i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish    boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz   but it remains just that  energy   not energy in service of a story or even acting    the cast seems lost   especially hunter   whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling    and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film   some violent confrontations involving the angels   who are not exactly angelic  in fact   they end up staging their own ransom scheme   some mystical hokum in the climax   and a cutesy claymation epilogue    watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell   stockpiling quirks in the name of cool    instead   the film just gives quirky a bad name    my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic   yes   misspelling intended   whimsy   which comes through in only one scene   an extended musical number where celine and robert sing   beyond the sea   at a karaoke bar    after a verse or two   the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos   and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter    the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard   just relying on the innate charm of the leads   allowing them to build a romantic rapport    alas   not nearly enough is built   for this moment comes to an abrupt end    i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses   but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill    a life less ordinary certainly delivers something   different     but by the time the film was over   i was clamoring for a life more ordinary       i can accept failure    everyone fails at something    but i can t accept not trying    it doesn t matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart        michael jordan  ,-1

 the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie   complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence    it s not abhorrent   or even blatantly unlikable   but it doesn t make a shred of sense    and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film    james foley knows a lot about characters and acting   and those are the strengths of the corruptor    but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense   and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train    at least we have chow yun fat in the lead role    chow plays nick chen   a chinatown cop    he s a good cop   as the first few scenes establish   and he s very familiar with chinatown    that s probably why the powers that be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace   mark wahlberg      nick and danny begin by stepping on each other s toes   but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one s life    what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me    i m fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons   led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu   byron mann      i m also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee   ric young     a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff    i m not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny   although this makes for some ridiculous   albeit unpredictable   plot twists along the way    there s also an interesting subplot revolving around danny s father   brian cox     but it doesn t have much to do with the main story    one of the problems   as i said   is that the movie doesn t make any sense    i don t blame this entirely on foley   because he s obviously a good director    i m more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci s script   which doesn t seem to be in tune to the way normal people act    one scene early on had me particularly annoyed   nick confronts his boss because he s angry about his new white partner    he s shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture   and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me       in addition   the film takes a bite into race related issues   and never develops them at all      there are a lot of scenes like this one   and none of them are very coherent    there s also a considerable language barrier   given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents    the plot itself never straightens out    i m not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are   or why henry lee is associated with them   or what they do as a group    the corruptor is an action movie   and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences    the sequences aren t bad   but they re not new   how many car chases through chinatown have you seen    on that note   how many chinatown cop movies have you seen    one too many   i d imagine    foley s strength is clearly in characterization   and he does a pretty good job here    the scenes between nick and danny are very good   and i actually got a feel for their characters   a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together    chow and wahlberg are both good actors   chow is a pro   and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep    wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere   but he s still fun to watch    i also liked the subplot involving danny s father   brian cox s performance is powerful   and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny    but the film ultimately fails   mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly familiar action scenes    a complicated plot can be successful   but the story needs to make sense when it s over    the corruptor never manages to make any sense    it just keeps spinning out of control until   finally   there s nothing left to hold on to    ,-1
    return to horror high     wants to be a couple different types of movies at once    the film tells the story of a low budget horror movie being filmed at the closed down crippen high   a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before    but what the cast and crew don t know is that a real killer   maybe the same one that was never apprehended   is going into action again    on one level     return to horror high   is a slasher movie   and it is at this level that it works the best on    watching the film   which was made in 1987   i couldn t help but take notice that the killer s costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in     scream     and   scream 2      on another level   the film wants to be a slapstick comedy   and there are many hints of this throughout    unfortunately   most of these jokes fall flat    and the last thing the film wants to be is a   behind the scenes   look at an exploitation film being made    the only problem is that   while much of it is sup1ed to be from the movie itself being made   no cameras are shown filming it   thus making it far more confusing than it had to be    and to top it all off   the   twist   ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever   and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time    there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous   and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through    if you see the film   or have seen it   you ll know what i mean    the premise of   return to horror high     is admittedly pretty crafty   and i liked the atmosphere of the school   which is where the whole thing takes place    but director froehlich   judging from this movie   is an incompetent director   except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene    well   come to think of it   there is only one scene that is actually scary   and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in    but other than that two minute distraction     return to horror high     is certainly no great shake    note   look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film    and strangely enough   he is the first character to get the ax       literally    ,-1
 the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany s in which the audience is rooting for some sweet   vulnerable   irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness    the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo   played by sook yin lee   as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible    alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene    this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland    one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa    she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window    next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild   adam beach      he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating    ben gets emotionally involved with alessa       as alessa so delicately puts it     we were bosom buddies   now we re fuck buddies        but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor    the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee s inability to decide what she wants to be saying    she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa    alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients    this appears to be a high profile and well paid job    we are sup1ed to care about alessa s feelings   but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father    alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint    this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double zero    i rate it a 3 on the -1 to 1-1 scale and a  1 on the  4 to +4 scale    ,-1

 seen december 2   1997 at 6   5-1 p   m   at the glenwood movieplex cinemas   oneida   ny     theater #3   by myself for free   free pass      [theater rating   * * *   good seats   sound   and picture]  there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons    they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context   from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation    watching   flubber   really clinched this idea for me   because it s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy    it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality   and how important it is to actually have a story    the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted   cartoony atmosphere    we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard   williams     the typical   sup1edly likable mad scientist    within the first 1-1 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is    phillip s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer s disease   isn t this rather lowbrow comedy    he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class   an inappropriate joke for a kids  movie if i ever saw one      we learn he has stood his up fiancee   sara   harden     twice at the altar simply because he s forgotten    sara claims to love him   but says if he forgets the wedding again she ll stop loving him   a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has      but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve   and it s no surprise the major conflicts here are related    christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft   a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip s ideas   but his woman too    what s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !  wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield   which is going broke   unless phillip can invent something to save the day    one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film    the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced   but is all but forgotten about thereafter    it s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber   a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy   and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny    unfortunately   the flubber   like all the special effects in this film   looks very fake and unconvincing    flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality   and by the time it performs a song and dance routine   you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object    most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy   since phillip s absent mindedness is forgotten about   and somehow push the story along    but it s clear how weak this premise is from the get go and the film just gets worse    all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast moving   flubber powered objects including   bowling balls   flying cars that don t fly well   and a basketball team capable of jumping 1-1-1 feet into the air    it s all presented with complete logic   and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes    during the basketball scene   the coach for the rival team actually says     i think they might be cheating     to which the referee replies     there s no rules about jumping too high         predictable   doesn t begin to describe the motions the film goes through   especially after the halfway point    and it s not how terribly contrived the plot is   it s the way it s broken down scene by scene   with absolutely no transition    not only that   but all the actors here   especially williams   seem bored to tears    i d say 8-1 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen   so it s almost forgivable when you realize they re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing    it s safe to say everything that could be bad about   flubber   is    the only original element the film has is the world s first romance between a machine and a human    but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it   and   like the rest of the film   you won t    ,-1

 for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking   or what s left of it in mainstream hollywood   movie which are star vehicles are terrible things    as a rule   the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor    an actor might be chosen on the up and up   to give him ex1ure   or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck    generally   though   the actor doesn t matter   and soldier   the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers   exemplifies this   the picture lacks pizazz    the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell   otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less    russell plays todd   a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought    the movie lets us see this degenerate process   but by the time the real plot starts   we re into todd s later years    he s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers   ones who   instead of being trained * from * birth   are genetically selected * before * birth    the pride of this class   caine 6-17   jason scott lee     will be our villain   and you know he s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie s start    between the two leads   less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken   and it s 1sible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction    director paul anderson   who helmed last year s icy thriller   event horizon   doesn t show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam    todd   upon being replaced   is left to die on a garbage planet   but in order to stretch the running time out   the villains return to the garbage planet on a   routine patrol   and set the stage for the final firefight    events are predictable from the time that the setups are made   and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here    the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be   todd fails to show physical superiority against caine   in fact   not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie   but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry    it s not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story   and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it    the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit   and treat it as a parody of typical action fare   like universal soldier    a strict interpretation   however   reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style   class   or substance   and by next year   a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television    ,-1
 director doug ellin s kissing a fool   released earlier this year   is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story    like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be im1sible to overlay a laugh track on it   the movie meanders along insulting the viewers  intelligence in almost every frame    the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you ve heard before         i m not wearing any underwear     the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster   max   in what she assumes will be a sure fire come on line      max   chicago s biggest playboy   decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam   short for samantha    max and sam 1sess two irritating personalities   and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience    max is played without any style by david schwimmer    schwimmer   whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality   makes an unlikely lover    his costar   mili avital as sam   is cut from the same cloth   so they can be argued to be a matched pair    after all   people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other   ditto for similar looks   so why shouldn t the personality challenged be attracted    the implausible plot has max asking his best friend   jay   jason lee     to hit on sam as a test    jay is sup1ed to try to get her to sleep with him   but stop short of the actual act    max   being promiscuous by nature   worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does    the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work    neither the script nor the actors make this test believable       the 64   -1-1-1 question is   how do you know you re with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life      jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film    finally   there is the film s attempt at physical comedy    jay s ex girlfriend natasha   vanessa angel   becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else    natasha rips jay s shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa    as she throws her hair on his bare chest   she demands he pull it    this is sup1ed to be funny    most films have some saving grace    some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn t    kissing a fool   on the other hand   has nothing to recommend it    kissing a fool runs 1   45    it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers    ,-1
 i am continually amazed at movies like this    that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind boggeling   but it seems to happen a lot nowadays       wild wild west   is a beautifully filmed   well acted   and well directed piece of garbage   and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault    in short   this movie is a comedy without laughs    so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal    the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco   but it s still pretty boring    will smith stars as jim west   an old western   r&b variation of the james bond character    west is teamed up with artemus gordon   kevin kline     and they re pretty much polar oppisites   west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets   gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach    talk about deeply developed characters    at any rate   this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies   none of which are funny    the year is 1869    several top scientists have been abducted   and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general   bloodbath mcgrath   ted levine      president grant sends west and gordon to investigate    there s evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana    west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr   arliss loveless   kenneth branagh     another disgruntled former confederate    as it turns out   loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon   which he will use to conquer the united states    i d go further with the plot   but there isn t any point    this film s narrative is little more than a jumbled   unfunny mess    i only laughed at a couple of jokes   and then only lightly    there isn t one truly uprorously funny moment in this film   and that s pretty disasterous when you consider that it s primarily a comedy    as i said   the fault is totally that of the script    when you consider their respective roles   will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have 1sibly done    the leads could ve been played samuel l   jackson and robert de niro and the film still would ve been awful    no one   and i mean no one   can make a line like   bye bye   mr   knife guy !    sound good    still   this film has a lot going for it visually    the set design is fantastic   maybe even oscar worthy    the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus   who was also behind camera in martin scorsese s brilliant   goodfellas       is absolutely stunning    he lends the film a much needed exciting   comic bookish look    i won t fault barry sonnenfeld either    he does a fine job of directing the proceedings   but   like the rest of the people involved with the film   there really isn t anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw    despite being beautifully made     wild wild west   becomes quite boring after the half way point    the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does    if   wild wild west   didn t look so good   it would be almost insufferable    as it is   it s somewhat tolerable   but not very entertaining    it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low   but there isn t anything much worse than an unfunny comedy    ,-1
 this talky   terribly plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux   an ex new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder  mystery after a light plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat    he and his wife annie   kelly lynch   rescue a little salvadorian girl   samantha lagpacan   from the wreckage and that s when the trouble begins    the other major players include a local drug lord   eric roberts     his scheming wife   teri hatcher     a soused stripper   mary stuart masterson     and a shady dea agent   vondie curtis hall      everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that s curious but never compelling    based on the book by james lee burke   heaven s prisoners is so badly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing    early on   we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves    nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa    later   dave is reunited with a drug abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation    huh    the whole movie is like this   perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf    whatever the reason   somebody should tell director phil joanou   final analysis   to recut this mess    in its present form   heaven s prisoners runs only two hours plus change   but it feels like four    ,-1

 some movies  pre release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they re finally released   everyone just goes along with it    thus sometimes   films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations    last year it was the thin red line    this year s   winner   is the hurricane   pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool    acclaimed director norman jewison s biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun    and that s sup1ed to be ok because   see   it s a true story    it s about rubin   hurricane   carter   denzel washington     a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly   racist !    detective   dan hedaya   who s had it in for the   big shot   hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife   in self defense but who cares   right      when rubin was only ten    he is to serve three life sentences with no 1sibility of parole    most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison    to the rescue    lesra martin   vicellous reon shannon   and his team of wanna be detectives    lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well off canadian white people   hanna   unger   schreiber   to get an education    lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book      the sixteenth round     rubin s autobiography    immediately thereafter   schreiber s character tells lesra   sometimes we don t pick the books we read   they pick us      hmmm    after a few visits to the prison   they become convinced of rubin s innocence and launch their own full scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him    they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses   i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces     and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane s innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings    of course   we re already told that he s innocent    a movie like this is especially frustrating because we re not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life    all too obviously   we re getting the hollywood watered  down version    that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could 1sibly squeeze out of it    it s almost cruel    the melodrama isn t of the entertaining kind either   it s the hokey   rammed down your throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity    witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo saintliness of our four protagonists    the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it s a no frills courtroom movie    it s formula stripped to the bare necessities    you have your wrongly accused black man    you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene    but there s nothing else    you d expect some sort of involving investigation    but that s not necessary since we re implicitly informed of his innocence    thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding    brooding to himself    brooding to other inmates    brooding to lesra    brooding to lesra s canadian friends    brooding in letters    i don t think i ll ever look at brooding the same way again    it wasn t long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane s exceedingly deep meditations on his condition    i wanted something to happen    as for washington s performance in the title role    i figured i d have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it s received    he is top notch   though still boring    how is that 1sible    well   he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly    unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap    what a waste of a great performer    speaking of wastes   why the hell did john hannah agree to do this    he s an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly   but what is he doing here    to call his character   along with schreiber s and unger s   a stick figure would be a gross understatement    all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas   as benevolent as do gooders come    if they re to play a major part in this movie   why not make them real people   with real feelings and emotions    look   if you re going to make a formula movie   don t undermine the formula    courtroom dramas can be fun   but this is ridiculous    not only is it trite   it s boring    ,-1
 all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos   please raise your hands    thank you for identifying yourselves   now would you all please go away    your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade   and it shows no sign of abating any time soon    it isn t just the strobe light quality of your twenty cuts per minute editing   or the numbing over use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised   featuring the music of         no   it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected   banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles    welcome to the club   scott kalvert    your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one dimensional   serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole    dicaprio stars as jim carroll   the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based    as the film opens   jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey   mark wahlberg     pedro   james madio   and neutron   patrick mcgaw      one night   jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine   and shortly thereafter to heroin    jim s addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral   as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach   bruno kirby     kicked out of his home by his mother   lorraine bracco     and drops out of school    along with mickey and pedro   jim becomes a victim of the street   living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower    the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years   but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner    screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll s 1se   resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic   but now with equally unsympathetic friends    as a film   the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale   a 1-1-1 minute long   just say no   public service announcement   but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is im1sible to care much about anyone in the movie    jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie   but i sup1e that his pseudo sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out    perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those   good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd   that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be   i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd    without a character who changes in any appreciable way   the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung out cohorts   all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack    director scott kalvert doesn t have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work   so he substitutes silly slow motion photography   self consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing    on only one occasion   when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in   are any of the gimmicks effective    mostly   they just draw attention to how hollow the story is    they also don t allow leonardo dicaprio s performance to be as strong as it could have been    for every impressive moment   like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money   there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics    dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors   particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex junkie who tries to help jim straighten out   but kalvert won t let character interaction define this story    he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star   shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting    at isolate moments   the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio s talents    far more frequently   it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like    ,-1
 depending on your degree of cinematic acumen   last man standing is either a   a prohibition era remake of akira kurosawa s 1961 classic yojimbo   b   a prohibition era remake of sergio leone s 1964 classic a fistful of dollars   c   a prohibition era action drama with a completely original story line    new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category   c   than in the other two combined   much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons    the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing   which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the  real  source material   the dashiell hammett novel  red harvest     it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself    this time around   the man with no name is played by bruce willis   a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico    by all appearances   jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town   with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border    one is headed by an irishman named doyle   david patrick kelly     the other is run by chicago connected italian mobster strozzi   ned eisenberg      calling himself john smith   the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict   and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle s side    but smith s allegiance is as uncertain as his name   and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them    viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint   and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes cum bastardizations    there is the happily ineffectual lawman   bruce dern     the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses  affections   karina lombard     the barkeep who becomes our anti hero s only friend   william sanderson     suspicious lieutenants   christopher walken and michael imperioli   to question the bosses  trust in smith   a brutal beating   and a big fire    director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids   including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity   but at least he doesn t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture    what he  does  do is nearly as big a mistake   and that is to provide a running voice over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard boiled style of pulp detective fiction    yes   that narration is full of cliches   but those are are not particularly troubling    the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters    they were a mystery   to the other characters in the film and to the audience   their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted   and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status    with john smith s voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought   he becomes more mundane   just another tough guy trying to stay alive    it feels like a hammett novel   all right   and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice   but it simply doesn t work    the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence   and the man with no name takes  no one  into his confidence    even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate   i can t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction    willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith   but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else    christopher walken plays doyle s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft spoken psychos   and there isn t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression    with no compelling antagonist for smith   there is no build up towards the expected showdown   and when it does come   that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about    cinematographer lloyd ahern   who also did the only noteworthy work on hill s 1995 flop wild bill   creates some nifty sunburned vistas   but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter productive narration    sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original   they ll wonder what all the talk was about    in the case of last man standing   it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about    ,-1
 okay   bear with me y all   cause first off i have to get this off my chest    what the hell is up with that damn crab        whew   okay    cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end   as cute as the crab maybe    even i know that you need more footage than * that *    and that wasn t the only thing getting on my nerves    the cutesy gimmicks   saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar   as amanda   and sean patrick flannery   as tom   might have held some appeal during   oh   say the first 1-1 minutes of the movie    at first the movie moves along at a quick   interesting pace    it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street   whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn t * die    a ridiculous concept   yes   but at this point i m willing to accept it because i m willing to accept that this is how amanda s life is changed   how her powers are received    later on   the movie can t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom    and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying   they weren t just repetitive   they were out of place and unnecessary    the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed   sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development   amanda suddenly becoming a great chef   her falling in love with tom   etc       sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good    some places the plot just doesn t make sense   sometimes it s way too contrived   the crab bit   for example     and sometimes too corny   peaches emitting dry ice    can t beat that      all in all the plot seemed fragmented   unconnected    not romantic at all   and only funny in some places    so   okay   do the magic powers come from the crab    or the fairy godfather    she can * float * now too    and all of a sudden   instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches   she can put her emotions into her food    tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda s   witchcraft   in the end    would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac s video    what the hell is up with that damn crab    it is unfortunate   because i liked the basic premise of the movie   until it became too fantastical and tiresome    the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while   but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables    the humor was good in some places   nolan gets the funniest bits   including that incomprehensible   totally random thing with the dolls      gellar and flannery are qualified actors   and gellar has a particular charm   but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy   or even annette in the upcoming   cruel intentions     than this sorry excuse for a character    it s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is   or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible    the supporting character nolan was a highlight   though he reminded me a bit of kevin in   you ve got mail     see footnotes      and   as always   typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy   there s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background   cued up at all the right places    this sort of got on the nerves after a while   too       simply irresistible   is not hard to understand   light   funny in some places   and generally disappointing because it can t draw the line between romance and protracted sap   between humor and tired slapstick    and how could i refrain from making a pun                   simply irresistible   is all too easy to resist       first viewing   2/6/99     * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to   you ve got mail     or   the shop around the corner        business rivals fall in love    female counterpart s business is in danger of being shut down    female as mother  like figure guiding her    the annoying   hysterical ex girlfriends     * i  really  like sarah michelle gellar s wardrobe    ,-1
 i went to blair witch project 2   book of shadows with the highest of hopes    the original film   released last summer   was genuinely scary and terrifying   i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor    unfortunately   my hopes were soon dashed    as the movie opens   the audience is shown pseudo documentary clips of burkittsville   maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie    it s a mostly humorous   self aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film    during this segment   we are introduced to the protagonist   a young man who sells blair witch related memorabilia from his website    the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously    we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia   but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies    we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette smoking doctor luridly leers above him    we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room   we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him    no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution   in fact   these scenes are barely referred to again    i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes   generally   a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting   filthy interiors   and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie    the movie cuts again   this time to the present    the young man   whose name is jeffrey   played by jeffrey donovan    as in the first movie   the character names are identical to the actors  names   although this movie admits up front that it is fictional   so there s no reason for the practice this time around     is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the   blair witch hunt     which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website    we meet tristen and steven   a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience    steven is a skeptic   believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria    tristen   on the other hand   believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence    she is wan and soft spoken   she complains that the radio is playing too loudly       she also complains that she feels nauseated   i knew immediately that the character was pregnant   and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out    how did i know    because in bad movies   nauseated women are always pregnant      the fourth member of their party is erica   a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch   not evil    they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery    kim is dressed completely in black   has extreme goth style makeup on   and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities   but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch    presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect   it s never explained    the party of five heads off into the woods as promised    they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr s house and set up camp   complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night s events    there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well   but after a few words are exchanged   the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere    the movie veers off at this point to spend many long   long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down    sexual innuendoes are tossed around   much hard liquor   beer   and pot is consumed   and nothing much else happens    this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary    the next day   the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed   and that steven and tristen s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds   like snow    the videotapes are missing   but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim   they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house     right where the original blair witch tapes were found !    ooh    spooky    the team goes back to jeffrey s house    a creepy old civil war era warehouse in the heart of the woods    to regroup and review the tapes    they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night    wacky hijinks ensue    tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch   everybody starts finding these weird rune like burn marks on their bodies   steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations   and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket    throughout the entire ordeal   jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes   which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps   eventually tristen wanders in   mutters something about   reverse     and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards    when they do this   they discover what really happened during the five lost hours       one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes    okay   if the videotapes were being buried   then how were they recording themselves       oh    nevermind      this movie was awful    simply awful    the characters are broadly drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development    erica is the nature loving wiccan    tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman    steven is the overbearing asshole    kim is the antisocial goth girl    old   tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures    how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic    because she s pregnant !  how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl    because she wears a lot of eye makeup !  how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy    because he has jagged teeth and talks like he s straight out of   deliverance   !  this is weak storytelling at its worst    rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic   the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics   in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action    it didn t work    on top of being poorly developed   most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid         honey   you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie    let s get on a plane home         no    i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what s going on         ok        frankly   by the end of the movie   i was rooting for the witch    i also felt that there was simply too much blood  n  gore in this film    the first movie worked by never showing us the horror    the witch was a palpable presence in that movie   but we never saw it   we never saw anything   in fact    the horror was all off screen   and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might 1sibly be    this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie    blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross out    this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey s throat   and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort    knives plunge into flesh   bloody fingers trail off into the darkness   and none of it is explained until the very end   when it was too late for me to care    this movie didn t stop with showing us the gore   either   it went for broke and showed us everything    by the end of the movie   there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours    it is all explained   in fact   it is all shown on screen in loving detail    i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster   or see only brief glimpses   mere suggestions of what the monster is   it is not because i find the monster so terrifying   but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying    i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no   monster     that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind    i found this to be a miserably poor explanation   if it was in fact the director s intent   then he needs to have some words with the writer   because it was not made clear at all       i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds   none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so    and if there was no witch   then what about the vanishing tree    the snowfall of manuscript paper    hm      blair witch 2   book of shadows was a horrible movie    from the poorly written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross out shots   it was a bad effort through and through    ,-1
 i m giving this stinker    normally   the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be    but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is   compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive   helped me come to the big goose egg    i m not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing   or if he was even thinking at all    maybe in mel s little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny    in mine   it s not    or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking    because only the self righteous lee uses the n word more often in his films than brooks did in this one    at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing    brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it    wrong mel !  i would call you a boob mel   but that insults breasts everywhere    this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor s   harvey korman   attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad    he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out    but the town appeals to the governor   mel brooks in one of many uninspired   and unfunny roles   to send them a new sheriff to protect them    the governor pawns the task off to korman s character hedley lamarr       i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name      lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff   gasp   in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave    hold on   i ve got to stop while these gales of laughter pass    it s just too funny    racism passing as humor    gosh why didn t anybody ever think of that one before    oh wait   i think somebody might have    they are called the kkk    i m not calling brooks a racist    but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn t know what was funny if it hit him over the head    but i digress    anyway   the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n word    golly   will the hilarity just never end    he ends up joining forces with a drunk   gene wilder     who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west    together   they save the day from evil    not one person in this movie gives a decent performance    wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie   and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie    ok   he really didn t    but he should have    the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day    i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience    i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions    actually   the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise   but alas   it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie    i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever    mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film    ,-1
 2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off    it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways    i m not going into much greater detail than that   since it would take forever to explain   and quite frankly   i m not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i ve already wasted    while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction   2 days in the valley falls way short    this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello   james spader and jeff daniels    while the story isn t much   and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better   2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots    james spader s character   while not much better than the rest   is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way    and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron   in her first role      you know a movie isn t that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women    even if they are both gorgeous    i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted    but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result    while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting   they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about    if i were to put a number on it   only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch    this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent   and even then prepare for disappointment    not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again    or at least not all of it anyway    ,-1
 what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie    a better question   what would inspire a studio to produce said movie    if you have an answer   let me know    foolish   the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw droppingly horrible film   one with no redeeming value socially   cinematically or otherwise    comedically it has some potential   but only in its stand up comedy moments   which i can turn on comedy central for    master p stars as fifty dollah    beat that !   as a mobster   i think   who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish   eddie griffin      but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss   played by andrew dice clay   for the very first time entertaining     a stubborn club owner and family problems   the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert s   idiot plot     if everyone here wasn t an idiot   there would be no problem    so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names    not a hell of a lot    as i have mentioned   master p cannot act or write    he acts like the rapper that he is    the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced   as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro    as for his script    well   i sup1e he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience    if you haven t yet figured it out   that is not saying much    co star eddie griffin   really the star of the show   is quite a different story    the fact of the matter is that griffin   whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network   is an extremely talented comedian   stand up and otherwise    he has much in common with chris tucker   rush hour   money talks   in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips    he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity   to the extent which that can be done     and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie    and indeed   i laughed at a few stand up scenes here   but from a feature length movie i expect more    foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters    every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke   in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers   foolish blurts out towards his jewelry sporting sibling   you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush     or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car   to which i said   a bit too loudly for the occasion   huh       after getting slightly upset with his wife    believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard earned $8    you ll get more laughs from watching 3-1 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don t have cable    eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative   although offensive   yarn   but everyone else should stay the hell away    &#137    ,-1
 synopsis   a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar    the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary   while his wife disapproves    meanwhile   a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession    comments   why is this movie called 1sessed by the night    it s hard to speculate    most of this film takes place during the day   and the only thing 1sessing anyone is an icky   pulsating   bubbling brain thingie in a jar    in case you haven t picked up on this yet   1sessed by the night is a bottom of the barrel   thriller     i use the term   thriller   loosely here   which is really cheap and bad    the plot   which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 195-1s   actually serves one pur1e   to exploit nude women as often as 1sible    writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging    there s really not much to say    the acting is lousy   although   occasionally   the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience    most humorous is frank sivero   who plays murray   the novelist s agent    he is so horrible in this role that one can t help but be amused    the plot sucks    nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession   even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole    the dialogue stinks    a loan shark   for instance   tells another how much he loves bimbos   which is something the audience really doesn t need to know    everything about 1sessed by the night is second rate   even the film credits    as the names of the not so talented film crew scrolled by at the end   joseph scales came up   credited as being   assistsant to foley artist      someone could have used an editor !  to be honest   the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes    playboy playmate shannon tweed   after all   is the star here    i sup1e that if one wanted this sort of thing   he would like this movie    why did i give this turkey two stars and not one    as a bad movie   it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film    if you feel 1sessed to see 1sessed by the night   however   i d recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else    ,-1
 okay   okay    maybe i wasn t in the mood to watch a mindless action movie   i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii   even while admitting that it wasn t as good as the others    howewer   the latest segal picture didn t look that bad   and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them   i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash    boy   was i wrong !  in the first half of the movie   we are already assaulted with segal s acting     he is not simply wooden   he is like a wall     gratuitous violence   an incredible plot   sexist and even more gratuitous nudity   and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes    by the end   it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers    not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided   which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense    of course   in movies like these   there must be a sidekick   and a love interest    in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model   in the movie     which only functions as a sup1ed comic relief   by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines     and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie    oh   of course   she appears naked from the waist up   and   of course   segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship   they did not even seem to be interested in each other    i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie    often   the villain saves the movie   unfortunately   the villains here are cartoonish   stupid and unfunny   unmenacing    how many movies have psycho ex special forces bad guys    too many    i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie   including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death   the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him   the scene where we are shown the hero s superiors are stupid   the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand   etc        simply said   this is movie making by the numbers   boring   and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience    my recommendation   if you go see it   bring a watch    you ll be looking at it for most of the movie    my    rent die hard    read a book    stare at the sky    do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid    the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen   once again   dragged in by my friends   which by the way   liked the movie halfheartedly    they probably like wrestling too          ,-1
 in life   eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison    after about an hour of watching this movie   you begin to realize how their characters feel    fortunately   for audience members there s a chance to escape the nearest exit    this   undoubtedly   is eddie murphy s worst movie and that s an accomplishment    remember the golden child   harlem nights    compared to life   they look like citizen kane    life is long   predictable   foul mouthed and only intermittently funny    its 1-1-1 minute running time feels like 1-1-1 years    robert ramsey and matthew stone s script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as   motherf       s   or   n            s      you lose count how many times both those obnoxious   offensive words are used    and if that all it takes to write a script   than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and com1e a movie    but   like life   it will probably stink    to be honest   the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up    but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well    life is as sophisticated as a belch    it s crude and stereotypical    years ago   movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient   second class people   good for being only maids and servants    for the most part   the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved    but a new   more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies    in many recent films   through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers   blacks are presented as fast talking   conniving   scam artists or hip hop   gun crazy   sex crazed youths    both sets of caricatures are demeaning    and the fault does not rest with the actors    they have to eat   too    it is with the people who write the scripts   the studios who green light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest    life s only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 9-1 year olds    otherwise   life is an embarrassment   a blot on the resumes of those associated with it    see it at your own risk    ,-1
 there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do    i delighted in the sneaky smart entertainment of ron underwood s big underground worm yarn tremors   i even giggled at last year s critically savaged big underwater snake yarn anaconda    something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth   spent in the company of ghidrah   the creature from the black lagoon and the blob    deep rising   a big undersea serpent yarn   doesn t quite pass the test    sure enough   all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place   a conspicuously multi ethnic/multi national collection of bait       excuse  me   characters   an isolated location   here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea   some comic relief   a few cgi enhanced gross outs   and at least one big explosion    there are too cheesy to be accidental elements   like a sleazy shipping magnate   anthony heald   who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology   or a slinky international jewel thief   famke janssen   whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold    as it happens   deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients    a terrorist crew   led by squinty eyed mercenary hanover   wes studi   and piloted by squinty eyed boat captain fin-1an   treat williams     shows up to loot the cruise ship   the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew   a few survivors make it to the closing credits    and up go the lights    it s hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film making   especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream    here   the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j   o connor   generally amusing as the crew s fraidy cat mechanic    writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action horror menace    something over populated with gore drenched skeletons   something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously    deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we re expected to have a ridiculous good time   not hide our eyes    case it point   comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda    in deep rising   one of the creature s victims is regurgitated back into view   partially digested and still alive    he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain   in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable    in anaconda   we also see a regurgitated victim   partially digested and still alive    he looks at another character       and  winks    make no mistake   deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing    it s also gloomy   uninspired and not nearly enough fun    i don t ask much of my monster movies   but i do ask that they act like monster movies    you don t have to show me a fantastically impressive   massive beast with tentacles a flailing    just show me the massive beast burping   and i ll figure you get the point    ,-1

 there re so many things to criticize about i don t know where to start    recommendation   turn off your brain   don t be like me   decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much    a comet is about to strike earth   causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event   e   l   e     that wiped out the dinosaurs    what follows is the story of a president s bid to think for the good of his people   a rising reporter   the love story of two teenagers   one of whom discovered the comet     and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah  to save the world    firstly   there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film   nor is there anything outstandingly good about it     but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid    to be honest   i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself   which isn t saying much      mimi leder s follow up to `the peacemaker  is equally incompetent   with all the big stars wasted       perhaps i m just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker  in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller   `the assignment       it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision   but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives    however   the film simply fails on that note    the effects are worn out   the substandard screenplay limited the acting   and the director continued her sad run in terms of good film making credentials    she s still making good money though    t   a leoni s unfortunate character   the news reporter   is the foundation of the story and of the cast    but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored    robert duvall s aging astronaut is lifeless   and morgan freeman s president is restricted to   well   a righteous president   which means he s not interesting at all      leoni s character is the only appealing one   and is played with reasonable conviction   but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc     but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters    warning   spoilers included   but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway      plot holes   plot holes   plot holes    now   e   l   e    is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race   and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there    where s the logic    leder could have at least made it plausible with 2-1    and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish   and those less selfish ones   the ones that stayed at home   were the victims    the film was almost mocking them   telling them they had died for nothing    i also fail to see how two teenagers   carrying a baby   would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill   even with a motorbike for a head start    it s unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle   but that doesn t really matter    building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr    strangelove    which pro1ed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years    now that is a more practical use for caves    what is the point of living in caves    there is no   unlike `dr    strangelove    any radioactivity outside to restrict ex1ure    how do plants grow    if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves   there s no reason why they can t do it in the open    the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves    obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago   and you can t be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media    in an important mission like that of the `messiah    for that matter any mission   it is im1sible that isn t sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres   needless to say tens of kilometres    this is not deep impact   it s a frivolous cheap impact    but even with all that   some overacting   and a 3   4 rating   it s still watchable   just don t think about it    okay    ,-1
 don t let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare    no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work   and this movie makes a vain attempt at that    any moves to   glamorise  his life   which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do   will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness    this movie about his life   although well written   puts too much make up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes   rather than lobster and champagne    oh well   let s fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play write   who falls in love with a beautiful woman   gwyneth paltrow   and from her inspiration   several plays develop     romeo and juliet    and   the twelfth night     it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that s how all his plays develop   but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama    but i guess my version probably wouldn t draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen    so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare   when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul    i think not    as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie    i think not    in many aspects   private ryan  and   life is beautiful  were far superior movies   but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar   as time and again   for reasons unexplained   an undeserving movie will win the accolade    another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead   over a more polished cate   but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised   people will start feeling sorry for you    ,-1
 it s a good thing most animated sci fi movies come from japan   because   titan a   e     is proof that hollywood doesn t have a clue how to do it    i don t know what this film is sup1ed to be about    from what i can tell it s about a young man named kale who s one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly 1sesses the key to saving and re generating what is left of the human race    that s a fine premise for an action packed sci fi animated movie   but there s no payoff    the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil   dredge   aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason    so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights   fistfights   blaster fights and more double crosses than you can shake a stick at    there s so much pointless sci fi banter it s too much to take    the galaxy here is a total rip off of the   star wars   universe the creators don t bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing   the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring    despite the fantastic animation and special effects   it s just not an interesting movie    ,-1

 writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard    harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun    harder than building a bridge over troubled waters    and incidentally   a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review    thrillers are all variations on a theme    you have a smart   resourceful   and powerful bad guy   who has a goal he has to meet    you have a noble and brave good guy   who has to protect the innocent   kill the bad guy   and not get killed himself in the process    the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner    this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest   high noon   or silence of the lambs   or big summer blockbusters like men in black   the fugitive   or air force one   or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds   event horizon   kull the conqueror          is anyone else getting depressed here    point is   it s not enough to follow the formula    you ve got to throw in something extra   something good and new and better than the last version    something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals    this is a hard thing to do   but it is absolutely necessary in every way    without that something extra    whether it s a great plot or a well written screenplay   or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs    the movie fails    that s why the jackal   with all its starpower   with all its budget   with all its hype   gets a big fat f    bruce willis is the bad guy   the jackal   a legendary killer for hire    richard gere is the good guy   a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal    the jackal is trying to kill someone    gere is trying to stop him    will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal       i ll give you three guesses   and the first two don t count      there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal   no moment when you say to yourself     i wonder what happens next      the script for the jackal isn t ripped straight from today s headlines    it s ripped off   straight from an episode of millennium    throughout the movie   we learn what the jackal s plans are and how he intends to accomplish them    no surprise    the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal s plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy    instead   we get two   count  em   two   scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal s plan just as if he s frank black   or more likely   just as if he s been handed a copy of the script      and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight    it s like gere s character is psychic   but neither he nor the fbi   or the screenwriters   seem to know it    and just like in millennium   the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about   whether or not they are important to what he s trying to do or not    what s more   in the last half of the movie   the jackal   sup1edly a super smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake   comes down with a major case of the stupids    as for the performances        bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack   which is a major achievement   but not enough reason to see the movie    his disguises are good   but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer s in the saint    richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent   which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance    sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie    not that his performance is bad or anything   it s not   but it is sad that hollywood won t use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent   shoot to kill   sneakers      writing a good plot and a good screenplay   like i said   is hard   but it can be done    it wasn t done here    it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones    do not go see this movie    you ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it    instead   stay home and rent day of the jackal   or in the line of fire   or a fire safety video   for crying out loud    anything other than the jackal   which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other   better movies    ,-1
 all right   all right   we get the point   despite all similarities to the best selling story   speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin    in fact   the script was in development well before 1992    still   the comparisons are inevitable   until one realizes a critical difference    no   it s not that the speechless twosome are speech writers   not campaign managers   it s that carville and matalin s story is actually interesting    speechless is a limp   poorly structured would be romantic comedy    speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign   where kevin vallick   michael keaton   and julia mann   geena davis   meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep    what neither one realizes is that they are on op1ite sides of the campaign   kevin is a sit com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate s speeches   while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate    at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship   but eventually they let down their guard and become closer    but there are plent of obstacles in the way   including julia s stud reporter fiance   christopher reeve   and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all s fair in love and politics    the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they re crazy about each other    screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other s arms in the first fifteen minutes   then developing the antagonism    it s a noble attempt to shake things up   but unfortunately it just doesn t work    part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do   but in speechless they already know they re attracted to each other   and we re left with waiting for the campaign to end so they ll admit that they love each other already    there is such a herky jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king s sharp dialogue can t prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour    inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton   and with those performances most of their scenes together    the problems begin with their initial courtship   which does virtually nothing to establish julia s character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise ass    davis is radiantly beautiful   and keaton is generally entertaining   but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit    in a couple of scenes   like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain   they actually achieve some measure of connection    for the most part   however   they re just actors spouting lines    you keep waiting for a little spark   and it never happens    perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless s politics    the setting seems perfect for a high  energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix   but that s never the tone that underwood is going for    he wants a warm   fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman s flute and wind musical score   and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background    it might as well have been a story about rival grocers   and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could 1sibly be    i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king s previous screenplay   the dana carvey flop clean slate   so i had some hopes for speechless    but while there is wit in the words   this is a script which was probably much better on paper    on screen   it s still paper thin    ,-1
 teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood    every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular   and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights   wallets in hand    the formula is very simple   you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal    you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds   and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 9-1 minutes   the typical teenage attention span    the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to   and   most importantly   they don92t care to judge films=92 quality   so any piece of trash will = due    that is just what never been kissed   the latest film from director raja gosnell   is   trash    josie geller   drew barrymore   is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times    she has her own personal assistant   unlimited supplies   and her own office    but she is very much dismayed with her 1ition in life    there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field   where she can play a more active role in the chicago media    so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere   she jumps at it with elation    constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita   molly shannon   and her amicable superior   gus   john c   reilly      the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment   as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter    however   since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict   this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes   and josie is headed for the field    obviously   the field assignment involves a high school    specifically   she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school   by enrolling in the senior class and   becoming one of them      i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the im1sibilities of this situation ever occurring   so i won92t    the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school    interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was   and she appears to be heading down that road again    fortunately for this lame production   other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting    they include the predictable love stories   between both a student   jeremy jordan   and a teacher   michael vartan     to show that josie is really two people in one body    also   her younger brother and op1ite   rob   david arquette   comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative    the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing    typical for teenage films   it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor    one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical    most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy    but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie    following this trend of high school movie rules   comes the general acting    it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film    in this case   drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch    she is required to play her character on two levels   having some very black and white transitions    and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray   she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time    at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel   and is expected to him on an adult level   since he is one   her teacher    but she never seems to get out of the gray area   and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance    following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon   saturday night live      she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to   and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic    it is these   qualities   that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent    luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film    david arquette   scream   takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic   and not have his brilliant acting ruined    and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini plot   which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed    in a dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work   he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit   risky business    never been kissed is a mediocre film at best    the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood   that it is sickening to watch time and again   and this film is no exception    the acting is just as bad   but there is the one 1itive presence of david arquette to add some light    unfortunately   the bottom line is that the movie will be a success   because teenagers will pay to see any trash    ,-1

 >from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker   the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong    at reagan high   four girls are sitting on top of the world    courtney shane   played by rose mcgowan   holds the title of meanest   most disrespectful soul in the school    everyone hates her   but everyone envies her due to her popularity    courtney is the   leader   of her clique   which also includes julie   played by rebecca gayheart   liz purr   played by charlotte roldan   and marcie   played by julie benz are the other three in the group    it is liz s seventeenth birthday   and julie   courtney   and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her   but the prank results in the death of liz    just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one   the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else    and also just like in other teen directed movies   one of the four don t agree with hiding it   this time that character being julie    and finally   just like in other teen movies   there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth    this time that character being fern mayo   judy greer     who is subject to many cracks from courtney s group   as well as the entire school    >from here   jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge   bad morals   and at least trying to do the right thing    not only is the script weak   on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast    judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional   annoying character   as she overacts every line she has    also on the bad side of acting is julie benz   almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers    on the 1itive side of acting   rose mcgowan performs well here   but doesn t match her wickedly clever performance as   tatum     in 1996 s scream    mcgowan s role is annoying   but this only adds to the film    she is wickedly mean   and even though she a well written character   you downright hate her    faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart   who is always exceptionally believable as her roles    when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character   she turns it into three   always putting strong emotion and power into her roles    gayheart isn t given as much to do here as she was in 1998 s urban legend   but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker    jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout   hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in    we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident   and get into things that don t have anything to do with the actual film    the beginning and ending are strong   it s just the middle that needs a lot of help    during the body of the movie   it is undeniably repetitive   never progressing towards a conclusion    nothing to grab the viewer s interest is around   and the same   extremely annoying song plays over and over again    jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless   but falls flat    the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang    all in all   a horrible disappointment    the bottom line   the tagline reads     even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside      yes   that is too true    no matter how good this film may have looked   it fails to deliver    ,-1
 well there goes another one    sadly this like other movies this year wasn t good    this one being almost as bad as  the omega code  but not quite    from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad   and well i guess i was right    with bad excuses for acting   a horrible screenplay and straight out bad direction  the bachelor  is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn t work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance    the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best    the movie is troubled from the start because chris o donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date    here is the stupid plot   chris o donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend   he meets anne   rene zellwegar   they instantly hit it off and are together for three years    jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up    he really doesn t realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her   what he wants i never did catch      so he pro1es in a really bad way   and she shoots him down and is very mad    he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any    then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 1-1-1 million dollars         as  long as he marries before the next day at 6   -15 pm    now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her   or get married to someone else to get the money itself   leading to an un funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths    ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest   cliched   silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs    even the supporting roles of artie lange   hal holbrook and ed anser aren t even good    the plot was a good idea   but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old    the choppy dialogue and bad directing don t help things any    even though chris o donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies   he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him    rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming   sweet and likable performance   as usual   and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout    her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen    brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big headed mogul who after a while became routine and old    one really can t help but think that we have seen this stuff before    it s not like this is an original idea and in the end   everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness     the bachelor  works on no good levels and in fact doesn t work at all    ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul   and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career    chris o donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal    he seems held back and really doesn t get into his character much and after even the first 3-1 minutes gets annoying and old    artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un nerving    why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie   with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know    maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success   and sometimes i don t agree with other critics on movies   even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts    its based on the 1925 silent film  seven chances  which i am sure is very better than this mess    even though some may think of this as a good date movie   most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back    besides being a terrible movie    the bachelor  is well a terrible movie    it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can t recommend this movie    i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times    the running time of the movie is 1-16 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes    parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time    being one of the worst movies of the year   we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies   and if they do they i give up on filmmakers    ,-1
 my inner flag was at half mast last year when nick at nite pulled   dragnet   reruns off the air    sure   i d seen them all at least once   but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv    even though   dragnet   is out of circulation at the moment   we webb anti fans still have the d   i     a 5-1 s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous   blue boy   episode of   dragnet      for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb s rapid fire speeches and straight faced seriousness   think of the d   i    as what would happen if sgt    joe friday ever enlisted   because he plays exactly the same character here   a no nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long  winded   melodramatic speeches on any topic    in this election year   i m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth    the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb s office door and enters    he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up    the   produced and directed by jack webb   card pretty much goes without saying    this is his movie all the way   and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason   i was wondering if there would even be a plot    i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants   but the d   i    gives us more    much more    webb s mission is to make a man out of private owens   the local screw up    the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or   the captain will   personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself         whether the   lace panties   part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered      this   of course   gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens  life a living hell    for those of you who haven t been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching   here s a reprint of a typical monologue of his    i can t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper   but the words should at least partially convey what i m talking about           now you listen to me   youngster    someday you ll wake up fighting on a beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn t get killed because of your foolishness        i ve got a headline for you   every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours   you re gonna turn around and i ll be standing right there      i couldn t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d   i       nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame     but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines   like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day s work by going to the local bar   where he orders a tomato juice      he meets a woman who   coincidentally   also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch rival   another marine d   i    webb marches over to the table   gets up in her face and says     just what kind of a dame do you think you are      bogart he ain t    the other d   i    gets one of the few memorable non webb lines when he confesses to the girl     he s a damn good d   i            i guess i m just a little jealous      join the club   we re all jealous of jack webb s way with women   which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene   as webb finds his way to the woman s place of employment   a lingerie store   and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the -1ligees on display       you expect me to talk to you        in  here    !   he exclaims   no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras    the woman goes off to help a customer   leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen    a little girl spots him in the store and demands     what are you doing in here       you re a man   aren t you      he doesn t reply   but you know he s thinking in his head     what an odd species of human    so small    must be one of those children everyone s been talking about      this poor girl   scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb   would later swear off the male gender entirely   just one of the many lesbian conversions he s responsible for    the movie doesn t focus too closely on webb s romance   it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie   where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills    after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea   webb asks owens     was that flea you killed a male or female      owens replies     a male   sir      webb yells to the platoon     this ain t the one !    that such a scene   along with the rest of the movie   was intended to be taken seriously defies comment    but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d   i     but for iwo jima   guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 2-1th century    webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie   with the exception of owens   were played by actual marines    someone wanting to parody this movie couldn t do a more comical job than webb did    it makes it all the more ironic   like raeeyain on your wedding day   that the man had no sense of humor himself    there s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter    webb bursts in the room and shouts     what did i tell you about laughing   !    to which the private replies     sir   only nine year old girls laugh   sir !    and let me tell you   i was as happy as a nine year  old girl while watching this movie    ,-1

 woof ! too bad that leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin and debra winger   because that s what s required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as  of all things  a psychologist    not since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude !  alas   mickey rourke   we hardly knew ye    story opens with a campy kick  willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy    she goes splat   he goes ugh   and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind    really    the good doctor then moves to sunny l   a     where he rooms with an old college chum   scott bakula     a therapist who s getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group    buddy bites it in the second reel   no surprise there   and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats    for his troubles as therapy man   willis gets to share some cut from nc17 love scenes with the lover s jane march while dodging nails   cars   and rattlesnakes    why d it have to be snakes    color of night is the worst movie of the year    period    forget north   clifford   or   heaven help us   even on deadly ground    here is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you can t help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming    for starters   the   group   is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis    these are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy    playing a prissy obsessive/compulsive   cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif   alone   may set the psychology profession back ten years    the plot s a wreck with laughable dialogue   pointless pov shifts   and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes    director richard rush   who once helmed freebie and the bean   doesn t seem to mind    unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations   he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany set pieces to make the effort almost worth watching    his token freeway chase is ok   but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala   most recently   fatal analysis    acting credits are across the board awful    willis can be forgiven because he s filming die hard 3 as we speak    but what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop    or lesley ann warren s stereotypical sex addict    or worst offender jane march as a mystery girl who s no real mystery    shudder    bottom line   how they all kept straight faces   i ll never know    ,-1
 there s only one presidential election every four years   but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as  the  thriller of the year    in 1997   we ve had absolute power   air force one   shadow conspiracy and murder at 16-1-1    this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford   trying to bring us a complex plot of cover up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys    here s what happens this time    it s night at the white house    a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt    the next day she s dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in    how do we know he s a hotshot    we ve seen the traditional action flick opener    the clever hostage -1otiation scene    it s not so clever this time   consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street    snipes is off to the white house   where he finds the secret service head   the shiny bald head of daniel benzali   won t cooperate with him at all    in fact   if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda   snipes wouldn t have been allowed in the white house at all    alda helps snipes out further   assigning a sexy secret service agent   diane lane   to act as his liaison        a very dangerous liaison    well   not really   i just wanted to say that    almost immediately   a suspect is found   an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos    snipes doesn t buy it   and launches into an independent investigation of his own   one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president s son    snipes  partner   an always  wisecracking dennis miller   calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane   who at first doesn t believe snipes   eventually and predictably comes around   and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information    for the first hour or so   murder at 16-1-1 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting    sure   we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that   but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon    snipes and lane don t make for a bad action team   but with nothing to work with   they re just cogs in the bad movie machine    dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie   they waste his talents more in murder at 16-1-1 than they did in bordello of blood   and that s saying a lot    when you get to the last half hour   the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer   busting out the old break into the building underground climax    and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why   you ll wish you never sat through this movie at all    the   16-1-1   in the movie s title doesn t represent an address   it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide    serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !  ,-1
 ah   and 1999 was going along so well   too       she s all that   has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i ve seen so far this year    and quite frankly   i doubt i ll see anything equally bad       at least   i * hope * i don t see anything equally bad         she s all that   tells the story of the most popular guy in school   played by freddie prinze jr     who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school   rachel leigh cook   into the most popular    that   right there   is problem #1    how many times have we seen this storyline    as cook comments near the end of the film     it s kind of like   pretty woman     except without the prostitution      of course   had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material   the well worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward    as it is   though     she s all that   relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead    there s not one original or interesting character in the film   either   and if that wasn t bad enough   there s not one good performance featured    the star of the movie   rachel leigh cook   is simply horrible    i usually don t like to get so personal   but in this case   i think it needs to be said    cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was    i was never convinced that she was a   nerd     and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary    the movie seems to be saying it s better to be popular than to be who you are    as for freddie prinze jr     an actor i ordinarily enjoy   he too is quite bad here    he coasts through the film on so called charm   and never establishes a real character    kieren culkin is here   too   as the brother of cook    and for some indiscernable reason   he s got hearing aids    no explanation is given and they re never brought up    were we sup1ed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids    i don t think so    that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i ve seen in a movie in a long time       she s all that   sucks    that s what it boils down to    it s not entertaining   and it s not even a good time passer    the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair removal system informercial    and what s worse   it sends out a bad message to teens    it appears to be telling them     hey   it doesn t matter if you re happy the way you are    that s unimportant    if you want to * truly * be happy   dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble headed moron      ugh    ,-1
 michael robbins  hardball is quite the cinematic achievement    in about two hours   we get a glancing examination of ghetto life   a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy   speeches about never giving up   a cache of cute kids   including a fat one with asthma     a hard luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic   big game     where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined    all that s needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich   s    i can t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd    obviously   hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball    it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler   who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam    out of solutions   he begs his successful corporate friend   the always welcome mike mcglone   to lend him $5   -1-1-1    instead   mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend    reeves   who wants to keep his fingers   accepts the offer   but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely    the drowsy voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs    and maybe   just maybe   they ll play in the big championship game    one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins   summer catch     adapted from daniel coyle s non fiction book   is that there aren t any    the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie    that wouldn t be so bad   if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them    most of the kids  time is spent yelling at each other   talking in slang and acting surprised    there s little that s naturally amusing about them   as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling    the worst of the lot is a tough talking younger player   dewayne warren   whose sole pur1e   as the movie unfolds   is being an emotional pawn   a tactic so utterly despicable i can t find the right words to express myself    the adults also don t fare well    reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down on his luck loser    the character is poorly written   but reeves gives another charisma free performance    every time he speaks   he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up    kids are sup1ed to rally around this guy    diane lane   who co stars as reeves  obligatory love interest   remains a glowing screen presence   see my dog skip for better proof      it s too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like     these kids trust you   and they don t trust anyone !    then there s d   b    sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves  scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you ve seen before and hope never to see again    i wanted hardball to be good    robbins  varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved    i haven t seen robbins  goofy ready to rumble in its entirety   but i am intrigued that   macho man   randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions    robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte    making sports movies for guys and not cutesy   cuddly pap such as hardball   which also manages to annoy and insult the audience    here s hoping that happens in the immediate future    ,-1
 you know something   christmas is not about presents    it s about over hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie ins    at least that would seem to be the message of   the grinch     which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores    hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season    you know the plot   there s this evil furry green guy called the grinch   jim carrey   who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville    down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation   but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas    the movie is   of course   a live action version of the beloved children s book   which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones    it s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty year old half hour cartoon   but that s the case when jones  version is compared to ron howard s    the tv grinch hit all the right notes   boris karloff s soft   deep narration   thurl ravenscroft singing   mr   grinch     max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head   and the grinch s wide   toothless grin    by contrast   the movie hits one sour note after another    first   there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 1-15 minute movie    young wide eyed cindy lou who   taylor momsen   is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents   bill irwin and molly shannon   during the holiday season    she begins to sympathize with the grinch   who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic    cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class   martha may whovier   played as an adult by christine baranski      are we expected to like the grinch   hate the whos   and want him to steal christmas    the grinch isn t even the villain here   that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville   jeffrey tambor   who was the grinch s rival for martha s affection    not only are the characters needlessly complex   but the once simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought    the casting choices aren t any better than the screenwriting decisions    jim carrey seems woefully miscast    while his face is so supple that the rubber make up seems superfluous   carrey brings nothing else to the role    his accent keeps changing   i assume he was shooting for karloff   but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon   sean connery   and cartman from   south park      not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch s home   carrey falls back on his stand up comedy and clowns around ace ventura style    needless to say   his wise cracking antics don t quite fit the character of the grinch   who is an embittered loner filled with hate    little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile    she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original pur1e in the seuss story   finding   santa   in her living room stealing the tree      however   the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch   and momsen is not up to the challenge    bottom line   when you re stealing christmas   movies     leave this one behind    ,-1
 in the mid 198-1s   following the splendid debut in hugh hudson s greystoke and relative success of first highlander film   it looked like christopher lambert s acting career might go somewhere    but   it wasn t meant to be   which became obvious following highlander ii    in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality    very often such films were science fiction   which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert    whether it was because of real lack of talent   terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn t important   the end result was almost always horrible    the same can be said for fortress   1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon   director who created cult following with his 198-1s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond    the movie is set in 2-118    for some undisclosed reason   usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child    jake   christopher lambert   and karen brennick   lori laughlin   broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border    sentenced to 31 years in prison   they are both thrown into fortress   privately owned correctional facility   equiped with state of the art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed    although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates  lives and make any escape im1sible   prison authorities often use violence    jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape    such escape should become necessity   because the warden poe   kurtwood smith   begins showing unhealthy interest in karen    after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison   this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity    the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich   s and situations that are painfully predictable    by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress   those situations not only begin to look predictable   but utterly implausible too    of course   film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society    the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters   played by not too interested or talented actors    lori laughlin   although physically attractive   shows the acting ability of sequoia    kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired   capable of solid   yet forgettable performance    lambert s performance is also good   but even the bigger talent couldn t help this film   destined to end in oblivion    ,-1
 susan granger s review of   the musketeer     universal pictures    hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $5-1 million adaptation of alexandre dumas s novel that s strong on action but weak on drama   fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay    the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d artagnan   justin chambers   as he leaves his village of gascogne   headed for paris   to join king louis xiii s elite guard   the royal musketeers   and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier    this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre   tim roth     vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu   stephen rea      the traditional musketeer trio   aramis   nick moran     athos   jan gregor kremp   and porthos   steve speirs     don t offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca   mena suvari     chambermaid to the queen of france   catherine deneuve      scripter gene quintano and director cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring do   as evidenced by choreographer xin xin xiong s elaborate   but not original   stunts   including a fast paced stagecoach chase   a tavern brawl on rolling barrels   high wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes   and a ladder fight sequence    filmed in southern france   the scenery   sets and costumes are spectacular   but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy   restless mtv ish cuts    as the swashbuckling d artagnan   bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing   totally lacking on screen charisma   not to mention acting skill    mena suvari   so impressive in   american beauty     seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 1-1     the musketeer   is a cinematic but shallow 3       all for one and one for all      not this time  round    ,-1
 note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    at the end of the day   those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros   made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere    this highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening   where it would have gone head to head against the rival studios  heavy hitters   its eventual demotion to a less potent mid august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio s lack of confidence with the picture    and with good reason    this is a joyless exercise of a film   held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement   thrills or wit    remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving   the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year s case study in style over substance   joel schumacher s much loathed batman & robin       indeed   both films even feature appalling   ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes      uma thurman   who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit clad   karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg   was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster   imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage    unfortunately   the same can t be said here   where she and cohort ralph fiennes   our new john steed   taking over for patrick macnee   demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever   fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they re on board a sinking ship    at this rate   usually splendid actor mr   fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man    his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably -1lected kathyrn bigelow film strange days    the duo * look * the part    and admittedly the avengers is   more than most   heavily dependent upon style    but they re no fun to watch   and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture s caper esque plot    when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat   i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs   peel    no   not kate beckinsale   although the notion now intrigues me     but gwyneth paltrow   who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot on english accent    if nothing else   it d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt    the story   such as it is   involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter   sean connery     an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption       they also sip a lot of tea      overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists  superiors   it sounds far better than it plays   and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant 1t production tinkering   it s clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds    the avengers was never about gripping drama   and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously   but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac   it s all decidedly uncompelling    mr   connery   who s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression   approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation   simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest    at least it all looks good    this is a genuinely handsome production   with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt    in particular   the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention   adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain    there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film   including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water   but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates    by the time the film s climax had arrived   my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain   but with the quickest escape route from the theatre    not coincidentally   the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie s remarkable trailer   a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself   the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year    it s everything that the avengers is not    saucy   clever   engaging   and entertaining    a crushing disappointment   the film is one of the worst outings of the year    too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad   too polished to overlook its deficiencies    there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers   but i sure hope not    ,-1
 stallone attempts to  act  in this cop drama    the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal   who s nephew   played by michael rappaport   is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths    keital dosen t really want to get involved in anything   gets rid of rappaport   and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on    this film should be brilliant    it sounds like a great plot   the actors are first grade   and the supporting cast is good aswell   and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance    however   it can t hold up    although the acting is fantastic   even stallone isn t bad   the directing and story is dull and long winded  some scenes go on for too long   with nothing really happening in them    in fact   the only scenes that do work are action scenes   which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid    in this film   serious means dull    the dialogue is warbling   and basically just repeats the same points over and over   no matter who is delivering them    the plot   which has potential   is wasted   again just being cliched after a while    in fact   the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro   both delivering their usual good performances    however   stallone   although not given much to say   gives a good performance    however   it s not all that bad    as said above   the action scenes are well done    theres also a very good ending   which uses the cinemas sound system well    in fact   the last 1-1 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997    if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending    cop land   then   turns out not to be a power house film   but a rather dull   and not every exciting film    hugely disappointing   and i can t really recommend it    ,-1
 the first species was a moderately successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects   a few well  paced action sequences   and frequent views of model turned actress natasha henstridge sans clothing    however   it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel    and   considering the quality of species 2   it s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead    the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is    if you throw away the plot   which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence   logic   coherence   and consistency   species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience    of course   that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys   who   at least in theory   shouldn t be able to get into an   r    rated film   and connoisseurs of bad movies    there s enough blood   gore   simulated sex   and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring    this is a grade z exploitation flick that s ripe for the mystery science theater 3-1-1-1 treatment    somewhere   someplace   i recall hearing species 2 described as   erotic      i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie   because he   or she   has a peculiar notion of eroticism    sure   there s a lot of sex and nudity   but it s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free   splattering blood and gore in all directions    anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater    i sup1e the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge   and   to get the obvious question out of the way    yes   she does remove her top   but only once   and only briefly      although the character she played in the original species is dead   government scientists still have the dna   and   out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse   they decide to create another clone    this creature   dubbed   eve   by its creator   dr   laura baker   played by marg helgenberger   reprising her role     is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile    meanwhile   man has finally set foot on mars    a team of three   led by patrick ross   justin lazard     has traveled to the red planet   but when they return to earth   they bring something with them    ross has become a half human/half alien hybrid   and he s soon mating like crazy   collecting the blood soaked children that are the result of each sex session    his intention is obviously world domination    standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film   preston lennox   michael madsen     and one of patrick s fellow astronauts   dennis gamble   mykelti williamson      but when patrick learns about eve   a female of his kind   there s no damping his ardor    i m not sure what the budget for species 2 was   but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors   as op1ed to being diverted into the special effects      michael madsen and marg helgenberger   both back for a second round   are clearly on hand to do as little as they can   grab the money   and run    ditto for james cromwell   who plays patrick s father      underused   is too kind a word to describe his involvement     invisible   would be more like it      george dzundza gets to do a little scenery  chewing as an angry but inept general    meanwhile   justin lazard s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge s limited abilities look good by comparison    the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson   who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick    complete with cheesy special effects   bare breasts around every narrative corner   and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter   species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics    director peter medak   a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume   has added another forgettable title   but at least he appears to have had fun doing it   which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness    do i recommend the movie    absolutely not   but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo intellectual bad movies do    here s hoping there s no species 3    ,-1

 everybody in this film s thinking of alicia    no   this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the   cryin    video    this is one of those erotic thrillers   but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed    first off   there s zero sex   almost no nudity   and it s not as well plotted as one of those tweed flicks    well   anyway    the   plot      alicia plays   well   the babysitter   who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents   j   t    walsh and lee garlington   go out to a party    the film   trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers   shows every characters  thoughts   except alicia s    the thing is alicia s in most of them in most cases   and the thoughts aren t too kosher    first off   there s her boyfriend   jeremy london   who gave one of the all time lousy performances in   mallrats     and is only a notch better here     who s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully   played by nicky katt from   suburbia     who shows he s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again      they decide they want to crash her babysitting job   looking for the typical babysitting hanky panky    somethine like that    the film intercuts between the subplots   alicia babysitting   nicky and jeremy   the party   and each characters  thoughts    we get to see jeremy and nicky s dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia   j   t    thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub   she has it all covered up   the little tease     and   worst of all   lee garlington dreaming of that hunk   george segal    it even shows them in bed together    yea    i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed   though i guess i m used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in   flirting with disaster      the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing   but come on    like we care about any of the characters    the only interesting one is alicia   mainly because she s alicia   and we mostly see her in the fantasies    so i guess she s some kind of mystery or something    but she is never explored further    so   basically   this film is just a series of mastabatory images   sometimes featuring a non nude alicia   once again   sadly     sometimes featuring a scantily clad george segal   once again   sadly      i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night   and let me tell you   it is the only way to watch this film    i mean   there s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night   they re just as good as sleeping pills    and this one is one big fat waste of time   even for an alicia film    ,-1

century fox rated pg   mild violence   thematic elements  copyright 1999 nathaniel r   atcheson  a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review    i ve attempted to obey this rule in recent months   but to do so would be im1sible in this case    the fact is   nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them    the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people    for me   they calibrated my creativity as a child   they are masterful   original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time   and they still hold up pretty darn well      i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release   but that doesn t make me any less dedicated to it    on the contrary   the star wars trilogy    and the empire strikes back in particular    are three items on a very short list of why i love movies    when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine film series   i got exited    when i first saw screenshots from the film   well over a year ago   i embarked on a year long drool of anticipation    and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving   i was ready to see the film    but then there was the hype   the insane marketing campaign   and lucasfilm s secretive snobbery over the picture    in the last weeks before the picture opened   while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater   i was tired of hearing about it    i was tired of seeing cardboard cut outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell    i just wanted to see the movie    reader   do not misunderstand    i did not have an anti hype reaction    the hype was unavoidable    i understand and accept the hype    it s just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released    five minutes into the phantom menace   i knew there was a problem       who are these jedi knights      i asked       why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity         why aren t these characters being developed before their adventures         why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film      these were just some of my questions early on    later   i asked     where s the magic of the first three films      and   why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes      by the end of the film   i was tired   maddened   and depressed    george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless   mindless   summer blockbuster    the phantom menace is no star wars film    take away the title and the jedi talk and the force   and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time    it s an embarrassment    i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored   or a new theme is examined   or a special effects shot isn t used    there are a few of each   but they re all token attempts    the fact is   george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects    this is not what i wanted to see    i didn t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth   but i did    the story centers mostly around qui gon jinn   liam neeson   looking lost and confused   and his apprentice   obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   who scarcely has a line in the film   and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo    naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation   their contact on naboo is queen amidala   natalie portman     the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people    after picking up jar jar binks   a completely cgi character   voiced by ahmed best     they head to tatooine   where they meet young anakin skywalker   jake lloyd   and his mother   pernilla august      qui gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin   and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys    the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious   neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters    there isn t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form    the way lucas has handled it   however   it unsatisfactory    first of all   we don t learn one single thing about qui gon jinn    not one thing    what was his life like before this film    well   i imagine he didn t have one    that s why he feels like a plot device    this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role   and why he s recently retired from film   i don t blame him   honestly      obi wan   a character i was really looking forward to learning more about   is even less interesting    mcgregor has just a few lines   so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere    since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace   lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie    things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine   young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed out character in the film   and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role    i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene   rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting    and when anakin says goodbye to his mother   i found it moving    also fairly good is portman   and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written    jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i ve ever had to endure   but he s more interesting than most of the humans    as soon as the relatively brief segment on tatooine is over   it s back to the mind numbing special effects and depthless action scenes    i ve seen many movies that qualify as   special effects extravaganzas     but the phantom menace is the first one i ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie    the reason is obvious   george lucas has no restraint    i can t say that i didn t find the effects original   because i did    the final battle between darth maul   obi wan   and qui gon is visually exceptional   as is most of the film    but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome    my breaking point was near the end of the picture   as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters   in the background   we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky   and i wanted that to go away    can t we have one stinking scene that isn t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot    i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours    and then there s the question of magic    what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi    i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel    john williams  familiar score is no help   nor is lucas  direction    i think it comes right down to characters   there are none here    i longed for the magnetic presence of han   luke   and leia   but i got no such thing    and what about the ridiculous expectations    mine weren t that high   i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving   a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects    instead   i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show    i don t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it   i d like to forget that it exists   and yet i can t    it s here to stay    i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them   because if they don t   then lucas will have pulled off the im1sible task of destroying his own indestructible series    ,-1
 the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and 1sible futures is a fascinating topic    finding an all star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius    combining all that with a three time oscar winning director   robert benton of   kramer vs    kramer     and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment    in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood    how many of these have we seen during the past few years       the atmosphere is moody   the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere    over 7-1 harry ross   paul newman   is a washed up cop turned private eye turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life    he s screwed up things pretty well     i had a wife and daughter    now   i m a drunk   and is at a crossroads    a couple of years ago   he traveled to mexico to bring back mel   reese witherspoon     the under age daughter of jack   gene hackman   and catherine   susan sarandon   ames and now lives with them    the ames are former movie stars   past their prime and the three have become fast friends    one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up    to fill his time   he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine    jack is in even worse shape than harry    he s dying of cancer with only a year to live    things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him    instead of the routine errand that ross expects   he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex cop who is   himself   full of bloody holes    this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine s first husband 2-1 years before    through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder   blackmail   guns   mel s mexico traveling partner and his parole officer   ross s former cop buddies   ex lover and would be sidekick   the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to    it s a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale   but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about    the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario    by the time they show you   it doesn t matter    the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross s relationship with rubin   giancarlo es1ito     a partner wannabe    these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief   however they are neither    rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it s not explained or i didn t care enough at that point to remember    a running joke about where harry was sup1edly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform    it s also not funny   doesn t connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course    on the 1itive side   it s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen    the three leads all have well deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished   if not extraordinary jobs    newman is a grand actor   but doesn t seem quite suited to the dark film style    he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out    hackman   also low key   is believable but lacks sparkle    sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one dimensional    the actors do what they can with lame dialog   but they can t pull the film out of the hole it s dug for itself    james garner who plays ross s old buddy ex cop raymond hope is always a treat   but even he half heartedly struggles through lines like   i m glad they didn t shoot your pecker off      the best part of the film is the look at old friends   how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make    the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen  the film doesn t run very long before the audience realizes that it s hopeless    the only reason for watching is the actors    it reminds me of disaster movies such as   towering inferno   where the star power is sup1ed to make everyone ignore the film s problems    in a better world   there would have been second rate actors in this second rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better    of course   we don t live in that better world   but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie    ,-1
 martial arts master steven seagal   not to mention director !   has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights   talks in a hushed tone   and squints at any sign of danger    he s also the most consistent individual in hollywood today   since all his movies suck    they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art   that is   martial art      i m sure the guy s good   and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows   although a tad haughty   but these movies he makes are all the same   a guy who is basically indestructable   is maybe wounded sup1edly mortally   then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses   although i kinda liked   under siege        of course   this one   as a change   has a   message   that is drilled into our mind       of  course   after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people    so why do i watch his crap    i usually don t    i will never   and you can hold me to this   i will never pay to see this man s movies   unless   and only unless   he s in a supporting role   i   e       executive decision     and i d definitely pay if he dies   i   e       executive decision        but this one has a special place in my heart    this doesn t mean it s good or that i even liked it    this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle   and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la   mystery science theatre 3-1-1-1     and this was a couple years before i had heard of   mystery science theatre 3-1-1-1      in this one   seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased up typical shallow villain   this time played by an oscar winner to give the movie some more clout   michael caine    it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land    around the 2-1 3-1 minute point   seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs   what with his new   fire down below     another   message film       and caine has him bumped off       or  does he    seagal is rescued by some inuits   and falls in love with one of them   played by joan chen   who can act   hypothetically   but   for some reason   not here    one of caine s cliched henchmen   played here with a lot of overacting by john c   mcginley   shoots the cheif of the inuit clan   and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory       literally    of course    at one point   seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn t have any options but blow stuff up    he even goes as far as to say     i don t want to kill someone     and in the same breath   he asks some guy where the arsenal is    i have no problem with violence    i m a huge john woo fan   but he paints his films with suspense   skill   style   depth   characterization   and just plain cool violence    in the films of seagal   the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly   and him either wounding or killing them    at some points   they use the cliche of the talking villain   where the villain has the advantage   can shoot seagal   but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan   or saying a corny line   to which seagal says something hokey back   and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them   and does    this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn t take itself seriously at all   like in the case of this summer s   con air      but seagal is serious about his skill   and of course   his message    i wouldn t mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence    but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle   not pounded into the viewer s mind    the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish   thus we can t take him and his motives seriously   and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment   he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig   and kills some workers who were just doing his job    then at the end   he spends a good 1-1 minutes giving a speech   just in case you didn t get the message from the trailers    what seagal doesn t realize is that no one takes his films seriously   although maybe a couple do   and any message he has is no only redundant   but doesn t comfortably fit in his film   which is filled to the brim with hokey violence   crap suspense   stupid melodrama   and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish    as far as seagal and his acting   he s rather boring    he squints   he kills    period    nothing else    oh   yeah   there s corny one liners     i m gonna reach out and touch someone !        of course   he s the star   and we re sup1ed to root for him and all   so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks    michael caine   who s a great actor   is just sup1ed to yell and look cold    he does it well   i guess   but this is no   alfie      of coure   no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him    his big henchman   john c   mcginley is kinda boring as well   but is not horrible    and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid   r   lee ermey   from   full metal jacket     as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is   just for the movie trailers and for seagal s ego    and also   look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey s assasins    anyway   to conclude this all   to judge one of seagal s movies is to judge all of them   except for   under siege   and   executive decision     though the latter is not really a   seagal movie        they all have this same formula   they all have the same action   same villain   same plot   but this one has that message   which makes it more excrucitating to watch    i mean   if you do rent it   and i don t reccomend you do   make sure you just skip the last 1-1 minutes    but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad   that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one    my   extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock    ,-1
 arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar   go to the movies   fall in love   move in together   etc    review ======  well   if you haven t seen when harry met sally or he said   she said   or if you don t watch love & war on television   you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages    however   if you ve seen any of these   than you have seen most of this film    this of course doesn t mean its bad    some of it is amusing   but overall   i just had to ask what s the point    arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love    kevin pollack is the stereotypical female fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes   most if which weren t very funny    couteney cox is the stereotypical career minded woman who falls in love    julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman       notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical    this film uses a lot of formula   the plot is basically known from the opening credits      so what is good about the movie    well as i said there are a few amusing moments    surprisingly   julie brown   who i usually find just plain goofy   was the best thing in the film    also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual    gee   this is really short    not much to say about the film really    it is just kind of there    watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time   but i wouldn t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre    ,-1
  soldier  is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn t have jean claude van damme in it    i could liken it to the sci fi cheese that was the hollywood product of choice back in the early 8-1s   but that would be too much of a compliment    if there is a movie theater in hell   this film is playing there 24 hours a day    the story   such that there is   revolves around todd   kurt russell     an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not too distant ultra conservative future   is there any other kind      after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him   todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy    who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed   but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn t matter   because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys    after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash    yes folks   there s more    we see todd as a buff   scarred adult   now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat    there s a new wrinkle   though    todd and his brethren are declared obsolete   and a new batch of soldiers takes their place    after losing a sanctioned battle with  dragon  s jason scott lee   the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice cube tray   well   that s what is looked like   on a remote garbage planet    if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet   and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them   you re way ahead of the game    the re-1ade society on this trash heap is so clich you half expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute    it s surprising that  soldier  is the brain child of  blade runner  co writer david webb peoples    unlike that mind twisting classic   this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double spaced pages    add into the mix the  mortal kombat  s paul anderson inept direction   and it s easy to see how  soldier  turned out so bad    and the special effects !  remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars    gary busey is in this movie     nuff said     soldier  is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults    that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all    now if you ll excuse me   i have to go weep for the future    ,-1
 it s a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it    such is the case for the 199-1 paul mayersberg film  the last samurai     though the blurb alludes to   a jungle filled with political intrigue   uneasy alliances   and murderous enemies at every turn     the story of the movie is actually quite simple   and prosaic     a middle aged japanese businessman named endo   played by john fujioka   and his assistant   both of whom have samurai aspirations   travel to africa in search of his ancestor   who went to bring buddhism to africa    he hires the services of down at the heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo   the redoubtable lance henriksen   and his girlfriend   arabella holzbog     and travels to the camp of an arms merchant cum safari host  cum islamic missionary   john saxon   and his wife   lisa eilbacher      they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch doctor aspirations to conceal a pre arranged arms deal   which subsequently falls through    congo escapes   finds endo s ancestor s sword   and comes back   guns blazing   to free the rest of them   and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword    the end     the last samurai  is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable    it is merely  there     the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated   subplots that are never explained   and many scenes that make very little sense at all    the film is shot through with all the tired old   inscrutable japanese samurai   and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie    it is quite slow paced   with only a bit of action near the end   and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic    most of the acting is fair   with the 1sible exception of congo s girlfriend    lance henriksen is his usual scene chewing self   and is one of few 1sible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie    the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery    i paid $3 for this film   from the discount rack at best buy   and halfway suspect i overpaid for it    if you are in the mood for samurai   read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie    skip  the last samurai  unless you are a die hard henriksen fan    ,-1
 birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives    are we doing what we want to be doing    what happened to our dreams    with the new millennium   our collective big birthday   just around the corner   some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence    the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren t doing it for many anymore and they re looking for something else    we ll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years    ricky hayman   jeff goldblum   is having a career crisis    the programming director for the good buy home shopping network   he s going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically    new producer kate newell   kelly preston   is sup1ed to whip things into shape    when the two are fixing a flat   they almost run down new age pilgrim   g     murphy      g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don t really want all that commercial crap    in some unexplained manner   this causes sales to sour    ricky is saved    the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all    it s not an over the top comedy or a heart warming message of humanity    it  is  a mish mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog    i am willing to put up with preaching from a film   but the messages here are old hat    you should take time to smell the roses    selling your soul for cash is a bad idea    golly    i m glad i saw the movie    i never would have thought of these    the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed    when g takes a chainsaw to the set   there s an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious    it doesn t happen    the bits are so subdued and overly long that there s only a hint of laughter from the audience    murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better    there are hints of promise in this one    the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen    the others are horrendous    goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career   but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his   invasion of the body snatchers      his relationship with kate makes no sense    they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen    preston is as uninteresting as she could 1sibly be    somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value    an attempt to satirize stupid television   we get a self parody instead    ,-1
 m   i 2   the sequel to mission im1sible   is a james bond wannabe film   but it fails to even come close to that film in wit   humor   and entertainment value    it tries to be a spy/romance movie   but without any suspense the film just looks like it s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses    it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human    the coolest thing about this movie   was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie   was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols    the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence    except for the choreographed action sequences   the film was dull for three quarters of its time   filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed    as for the action scenes   they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films   but their advertisement for sadistic responses   is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence   which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen    m   i 2 opens and closes with fast paced action scenes   but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue    the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus   at that point    the only thing that kept me awake   was the horrible music com1ed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film s sup1edly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way    it s a mega buck film adapted from a popular high tech gadgetry tv series    but its artistic success is an im1sible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it   and it failed to produce a story that had any substance    john woo     broken arrow   /   face/off     is good at doing car chases   choreographed fights with midair flips and kung fu kicks   slo mo shots of two guns blazing   and of fire explosions   but he just can t seem to handle dialogue and suspense    the star of the film and co producer   tom cruise   and his romantic interest   thandie newton   are miscast    cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile   as he tries to carry off this macho role   while thandie is not an action film girl   and seems like a fish  out of water in this one    their romance didn t work   not only was it tepid and not sexy   but it wasn t convincing    the film opens with dizzying speed   perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success    we will be in three different locations instantaneously   sydney   the american southwest   and seville    first   we are in sydney   australia   where a scientist with a muffled russian accent   dr   nekhorvich   rade     mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it    he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain    which explains the film s mythic theme       as  we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil    the one who played the villain   dougray scott   does so in a one dimensional gruff tone   which did not distinguish him in that role    at least   if the film got the villain part right   it might have had some fun with this nonsense    soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri   but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains    before they crash the plane and parachute out of it   the one who was 1ing as dimitri   turns out to be sean ambrose   scott     a rogue member of the imf   which is a cia like clone    he steals the package with the antidote   peels off a latex mask   which is a replica of the hero of the story   ethan hunt   cruise     who had 1ed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust    sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices    we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission im1sible   which as convoluted a plot as that film had   it was still a superior film to this sequel    woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground   as it is used so often in this film by both sides   so much so   that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain    it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character   which distorts the reality of the film and makes it im1sible for the film to make much sense    next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest   and ethan is on vacation   hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool   when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard   delivers via a rocket launcher   a pair of talking sunglasses    hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help   billy baird   john polson   and luther stickell   ving rhames     with luther running a high gadget computer   but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall   thandie   to join his team    he is told   as an incentive to recruit her   all her criminal charges will be dropped    hopkins then signs off with the tag line   this message will self destruct in five seconds    actually   with the departure of hopkins   it was this dis1able film that actually self destructed at this point    in seville   hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase   where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road    he also falls for her when this was only sup1ed to be a business deal   and learns that she is valuable because her ex boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her    the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him   as she leads them to his hide out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort   the south african   hugh stamp   richard roxburgh      robert towne   the screenwriter   who contributed to the first   mission     who is noted for doing   chinatown      writes a colorless   pedestrian script   one that fails even to be funny in a camp way    the terrorists   who aim to rule the world   are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options   as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote   insuring that they will make billions on the stock    ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah   with his only conflict being who is more important to save first    ethan does this rescue against all odds   as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company   fight it out with sean and the other terrorists   and rescue nyah   who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean s getting it   as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle    ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle   using kick boxing   winning a shootout   throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists   making some more use out of that peeling mask bit   and by being completely fearless and larger than life   while he kick s everyone s ass    if i was only entertained by this       i  could have lived with it    but this film was so badly made   that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game   seeing only the slam dunks   but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast    in any case   this is a critic proof film   and will in all probability do well in the box office   as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into    ,-1
 ex universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer model engineered fighters gone bad    the review  jean claude van damme has a one liner early on in universal soldier   the return   his latest attempt to remain relevant   that sums up this entire movie   he says   been there   done that      no film critic could 1sibly sum up van damme s recent film choices any better    while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres   schwarze-1ger makes as many family comedies as he does action films     van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him   martial arts and guns    this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world   with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex    he joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away    universal soldier   the return is truly poor    the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade   specifically terminator 2   judgement day and the similarly named soldier    soldier s kurt russell was an older model super soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors   for the good of a planet   schwarze-1ger s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine   the t 1-1-1-1   and jean claude   a former universal soldier   has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of   you guessed it   newer model soldiers    considering the poor box office performance of soldier   it s amazing that this project was ever given the go ahead    luc devereaux   van damme   was the sole remaining universal soldier   or unisol for short     until he was returned to a normal   if muscular   human form    in this sequel   technically the fourth film in the series   following two straight to video duds that were ignored here plot wise     luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program    working with dylan cotner   xander berkeley   who interestingly also appeared in t2     the unisol program has engineered a tougher   fiercer fighting force with the help of super computer seth    unfortunately   upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government   seth takes control of his soldiers   killing everyone in the building except for luc   his partner maggie   his daughter hillary and erin   a reporter trapped inside    the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive   while beating up a group of near indestructible soldiers   most notably romeo   popular wrestler goldberg      there are lots of fights   gun battles   lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility    there are so many clich   s in this film that it is almost painful to watch    luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on   and in the course of a single night   they go from bickering to falling for each other   to kissing    erin is a pathetically written character   people are getting brutally gunned down all around her   and yet   not only does this not seem to frighten her   but she finds time to remind luc that she   isn t leaving without her story      whatever    other laughable moments include a   luc going to a strip club to get internet access   what     and b   a group of rangers   who after having been given good advice   luc tells them that their weapons are useless   and shows them a specific gun which should work better     choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway   guess who wins the battle        not one single scene in universal soldier   the return has any originality to it    when fuelled by don davis  loud   driving music score   the film s many fights become almost passable   but mostly are full of the same ol  jean claude moves    director mic rodgers   a former stunt co ordinator   keeps the action coming at a rapid pace   with only a few token serious moments to be found    his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows   tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion    if only jean claude weren t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li   rodgers could probably have made a decent action film    to place the blame squarely at van damme s feet   however   is an injustice    i m not sure that anyone   not even robert deniro or edward norton   could make writers william malone and john fasano s script sound good    one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access    he cringes   looks down and mutters   uh       uhm        they all do   i saw it on 6-1 minutes    eh he he he   the script s and indeed the entire film s only saving grace is goldberg    he chews up every scene he is in   obviously enjoying his role immensely    he even gives the film a few laughs   as he mutters things like   i really don t like that guy   every time he fails to kill luc    sadly   his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier   the return into anything better than a below average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight to video    ,-1
 the plot of big momma s house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    that s not just the high concept premise   it s the fully realized   all encompassing plot    such an emphasis is not unheard of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment    one need merely look back to last summer   when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent    the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high concept plot idea better be pretty well realized   or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer   because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time    not a developed character   not a provocative theme   not a witty twist    you will get 9-1 plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    nothing more   nothing less    those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one note dud that is big momma s house    others will simply stare   mouth agape   at its sheer unapologetic laziness    lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner   an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john   paul giamatti      dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco   terrence howard   has escaped from prison   and the feds think he s headed for his former girlfriend and presumed but never proved accomplice sherry   nia long      sherry   however   has fled with her son trent   jascha washington     1sibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae   ella mitchell     better known as big momma    indeed   sherry appears to be on her way   but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming    that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows    big momma s house s bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs    doubtfire    director raja gosnell edited that film   and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom    but there s just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character s attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman    unfortunately   big momma s house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made   instead of having the protagonist 1e as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses   it places malcolm in the 1ition of playing a friend and family member to several other characters    suspension of disbelief in big momma s house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid   since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other    of course   laughs trumps logic every time   and big momma s house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny    and it misses its best 1sible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul tempered beast   while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry    unfortunately   no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another   very different real person   so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags   malcolm reacting violently to big momma s explosive diarrhea attack   malcolm as momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball   malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments   malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife   one of the few sequences that works      martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times   but there s no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character    he s just big momma without the makeup on    i won t waste time commenting on how ineptly the set up of the escaped convict is employed   since it was clearly a waste of time to the film makers    there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure   but he s ultimately a distraction in a film that s really about its central visual incongruity   and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long s 1terior      i m never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people    several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing    but i know that when a film maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it s an entire film   i duck out of the way    the gross implausibility of big momma s house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big   cleverly constructed laughs    its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant    big momma s house is ridiculous  and  not funny    it s just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress    ,-1
 starring william baldwin   cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right   the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role    not that cindy does that bad   it s just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy s extraordinary acting skills   but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation    and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty   but i m sure that that is just a coincidence   no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet   well   that s just a happy coincidence    sure    william baldwin isn t a bad actor    unfortunately   he just doesn t demonstrate it at all in this movie    i m not sure if that s because most of his lines were just so hokey   or if he was trying to make cindy s acting look good    if it was the latter   it worked    cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie    which is not to say that she doesn t have room for improvement    although to be fair to cindy   her lines were kinda cheesy in places    so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford   arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet   chose for her foray into the world of cinema    well   i m glad you asked that question    cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents    why woud they target someone as likable as cindy   you ask    by the end of the movie you won t care    the story is so contrived it isn t funny    anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house   without getting so much as a scratch i might add   she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin    who s character   max kilpatric   a police detective   seems to 1sess the skills of some sort of fighting machine   my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal s early films      the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin s characters of the run from these killer russians isn t all that bad of an idea   it s just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud    the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes    if i was baldwin   i d hope this film disappears    as for crawford   she may indeed have some acting ability    unfortunately   any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad    this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind   since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks    it s too bad they hadn t spent more time on a half decent plot   since ms   crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much    unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you    ,-1
 take a look at the following equation          a christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged  yes   scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment   comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether    scrooged is alternatively sick   gross   funny   and then sickly soppy    bill murray plays frank cross   a t   v executive with a horrible personality    he s evil to secretary   actors   crew   everyone   except the t   v s station s boss   of course   played by the late robert mitchum   however   he is then visited by a very dead exec   who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts   past   present and future   who is called the ghost of yet to come   for some reason   sure enough   they arrive   show cross how much of a s   o   b he is   and he changes his way    however   throughout this simple plot   we ve got to suffer outlandish special effects   poor comedy   and an very   very mean performance from bill murray    frank cross isn t  funny  mean   he s just mean    he also isn t very good at emotional scenes   and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film   with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is   and how he has changed    however   the supporting cast are ok   with good performances from mitchum   allen   who plays his girlfriend   and john glover   who plays cross s  partner    the ghost of christmas past isn t that bad either    sadly   though   the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of  home alone  style violence from the ghost of christmas present   played by carol kane    whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny   should be fired straight away    and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait   the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3   if i remeber correctly            who   thankfully   dosen t say much    the script is horrendous    michael o donaghue churns out terrible   bad taste jokes   which i guess is the whole point really   then changes direction completely to emotional scenes    and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes   which are awful    the special effects look nice   but do nothing for the film    there s some impressive make up effects also    the music is also good   which is scored by danny elfman    but great effects and make up don t make a great film    scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience   seeing as the first 1 hour 2-1 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway   and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech    why didn t cross just look out his exec window   and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him    overall   then   you d have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided   perhaps a plague    ,-1
 synopsis   a maniac   crazed by virulent microphage   slaughters more than twenty people   including a street gang and heavily armed troops   with a small knife    even with a handgun   however   he can t take out the two cops who are after him   despite having shot one of them a total of seven times    comments   the most notable aspect of adrenalin   fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge    not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on   her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as 1sible     but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses    this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans   but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive   capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles   though   i admit   it doesn t show in this mess      henstridge   just like every other actor in the film   delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey       the cast also includes christopher lambert   who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films      how on earth this movie got two big name stars to appear in it is beyond me    adrenalin   fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future   2-1-17      boston has changed dramatically in those ten years    it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with   policia   printed on their doors    some guy has a really bad virus   and he s killing people because of it    so   the brave good guys   lambert and henstridge   go after him    that s it    76 minutes never seemed so long    this is a drawn out chase scene through dimly lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie    the plot development is nil   we learn absolutely nothing about lambert s character and very little about henstridge s character    the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight    a subplot does exist involving henstridge s character s illegal attempt to get her son out of boston    in her opening monologue   a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards   we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son    twenty minutes into the film   i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot    in a defining scene of the movie   however   i changed my mind    this fake passport drops to the ground    lambert s cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away    must not have been a good fake    this emphasizes another fault with the film    things just defy common sense    lambert s cop   for instance   is shot seven times   yet he is still able to talk and slide about    adrenalin   fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn t seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for    i found myself rather bored with this film   which will disappoint both sci fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert    don t fear the rush    fear the movie    watch something else    ,-1

 at first glance   i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise    its plotline goes like this   the evil king cromwell   desiring to take over the world   resurrects an evil   ancient sorceror   xusia for power    he attacks the kingdom of eh dan and kills young prince talon s parents    given a triple bladed sword   which can shoot bad guys   like a gun   by his dying father   talon vows for revenge    eleven years later   when he s established his own army   the mercaneries   he vows to take back his kingdom    along the way   he meets up with alana   whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell    talon vows to help   and   after a series of minor escapades   eventually ends up rescuing alana s brother   and several other prisoners     only to be captured himself   in other words   put on a cross to be crucified !      fortunately he frees himself   rescues alana from marrying cromwell   defeats xusia   and then cromwell   all with his triple bladed sword   during the final battle   the blade breaks   but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade      then   everything ends happily    unfortunately   the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds    what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping   bad acting   and gruesomely gory   bloody scenes    never once does the story seem to connect together   it just jumps around repeatedly    this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia    after telling him that he needs his help   he leads the warlock out into daylight   but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards    wait a minute   didn t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh dan   which he cannot do by military force    if that is the case   why does he dis1e of xusia after resurrecting him    and why does he manage to take over eh dan anyway    these questions are just never   no   never   answered in the film    another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life   another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana s wedding to cromwell   !     and finally at the end   instead of settling down with alana   he just tells her to   wait     and then he just rides off !  in addition to the extremely bloody scenes   this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure    even some attempts to make it exciting   a few fire scenes   battle scenes   don t work    it just completely fails altogether miserably    the only good thing about this film is its musical score   contributed by david whittaker   who had an   extremely   short music com1ing career    the score is boomy and adventurous   powerful   and a billion times better than this film is    my suggestion   steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead   if you can find it      ironically   though   before the film s credits roll   there is a message indicating that a sequel   tales of the ancient empire   would follow    to my relief   and delight     it never got into production   because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office   grossing only $39 million    critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer   all right    leonard maltin rightfully called it   second rate in scripting   and acting   and at a glance film reviews called it   a confusing   stupid   unimaginative   unengaging   bloodfilled bore      i totally agree with these reviews   all right   and i hope that this piece of #$% !  will be forgotten about    there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer    i hope you get a good laugh out of this review   but i am not laughing    in fact   my insults don t even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 1-1-1 minute running time    ,-1
 this movie stinks !  although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances   the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss    i knew i was in for trouble when   during the opening establishment shots   we see a detailed close up of warrant officer paul brenner s   john travolta   military identification card and it is the wrong color    this might seem like a minor detail   but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow    and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training    or what about when brenner tells a suspect that   because he is in the military   he doesn t have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision    how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts    now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up   but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through    for example   at the beginning of the film   paul brenner   an undercover army investigator   gets into a gun and knife battle at his off 1t houseboat and winds up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating    the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing    but instead of arresting him   or at least take him into custody for further questioning   they release him    duh !  ultimately   brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and 1sible rape of the commanding general s daughter   a young captain also assigned to the 1t    when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general s daughter   does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects    no   his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing    eventually   brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier    i won t even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army s suppression of this horrendous crime    i will just mention one final flaw    brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia    the rape occurred in west point   which is in new york    he is under a very tight   and totally implausible   36 hour deadline to solve this case    he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point    does he phone the doctor    no   he travels   via some unexplained very fast transport   to new york to question the psychiatrist in person   and then he returns to georgia   again by the miracle transport     without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline    you have been warned   stay away from this one    ,-1
    it was not scary      these are the first words that came to mind after it was over    when a movie is called  vampires      not scary   aren t words that should be associated with it    but that wasn t my only gripe    john carpenter is a name associated with cutting edge cinema   as in the intense scares of  halloween     the thing  and  the prince of darkness    or the offbeat action of  they live  and  escape from new york     unfortunately   the only thing that is cutting edge about  vampires  is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach    with an anemic plot and not quite kosher special effects    john carpenter s vampires  has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan    the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers   led by james woods   of all people    like some sort of holy a team   they even have their own souped up van     the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack    their method is amusingly innovative   the blood suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks    to commemorate their victory   the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away    their celebration is short lived   however   as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single handedly destroys most of the team    woods  jack crow and buddy montoya   daniel baldwin   escape with their lives   along with a woman named katrina   sheryl lee      although the woman has been bitten   montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire    the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys  hunt for valek   thomas ian griffith     a freaky marilyn manson type who s on a mission that dates back 6-1-1 years    along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau   tim guinee     a character who serves pretty much the same pur1e as the jittery cpl    upham in  saving private ryan     some stuff happens in the middle of the movie   but i can t remember most of it   because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen     vampires  finally starts to pick up about 9-1 minutes into the mix   as crow   guiteau   and montoya assault an abandoned prison turned vampire nest    only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick    but it s too little too late    we get the inevitable final confrontation   but it seems tacked on and rather anti climactic   come on   we re dealing with  the  master vampire here !    interestingly   last summer s vampire actioner  blade  was derived from a comic book   and  vampires  from a novel   yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former   a more deliberate superhero flick    woods  jack crow spouts glib off the cuff one liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh so cool stride    and his motive for killing vampires    take a wild guess       hint   a        killed his       when he was just a            at least  blade  had decent action and slick stylishness     vampires  lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer thin plot    to make up for this   the movie resorts to other   shocks     such as its generally condescending attitude towards women   crow slaps them around for the fun of it   and an overplayed contempt for religion   crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to   getting woodies        it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie    if not scary and gory   i wanted tense   relentless   and exhausting     john carpenter s vampires  is none of these    i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan    for the rest of you looking for a good scare   beware    vampires  is a film with no teeth    ,-1
 perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with         this is the fake news     norm macdonald   at times   could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi offensive phrases in his raspy voice   coated with a condescending attitude    his shtick was marked by crassness    in this movie   for example   when his girlfriend says that she s kicking him out because he s been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months   he tries to calm the situation by saying     maybe you ll feel better after we have some dirty sex      this kind of humor can only go so far   but certainly can t go the distance in a full length feature       dirty work     is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically    emotionally   they ve never outgrown their pubescent years   which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback    although having no apparent real world skills   the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people    if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket   then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart    mitch   norm macdonald   and sam   artie lange   need to come up with $5-1   -1-1-1 in a period of two weeks so that sam s dad   jack warden   can have a heart operation    their idea is to start a revenge for hire business where they ll do your dirty work    in the funniest scene   and 1sibly the only funny scene   of the movie   they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot    their presence is established   but when a less than honorable real estate developer hires them and then re-1es on the payment   the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge    by default   dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots   but it delivers jerky boys level material    except for the bit at the used car lot   and 1sibly another episode that involves frat brothers     the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call    already weak on material   it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs  broads  and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction    but what s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor    relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying   note to self       note to self   learn to fight     he says after getting beat up     note to self   there s always beer     he says after hitting rock bottom   etc       we feel like we re just watching an elongated rehash of his not so glorious days on saturday night live    much like the television show   for 9-1 minutes we get one or two funny bits    the rest of the story is just dead space    ,-1
 summer movies are   by nature   dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money    wild wild west   the latest will smith affair   follows much the same formula   except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies    will smith plays jim west   a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses    he is called by president grant   kline   to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing    west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon   kline again   and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind   named dr   loveless   branagh   with a zany moustache      before i pile on with the many -1atives in this sorry affair   i ll give it a chance with the 1itives    there s a nice credit sequence   the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye   and the special effects are decent enough    there s also a pleasant soundtrack    buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes    and salma hayek pops up as the female interest   which is always nice to see    apart from these factors   though   nothing else in wild wild west works    firstly   there s little chemistry between smith and kline   who appears to be in it purely for the money    one would expect zingers passing between the two   none arise    both of them plod through the below standard plot   knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end    not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment   although he is over the top   the material doesn t present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy    therefore   he just comes across as loud as obnoxious    the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek   who is given so little screen time it s embarrassing    she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body   and be ogled at by kline and smith    her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script   and there is no sense of realism about the character    the  humour  in the film is also very off    will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black   here   not even smith could save the humour on display    the script largely boils down to insults that aren t very funny   and one liners that barely raise a smirk    it s also somewhat racist   although it doesn t intend to be   with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching   and actually says slavery is good to save himself    it s not a funny scene   and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably    the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man   in this case kline   in a dress is automatically unfunny   it isn t   but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness    there s also problems with the plot    jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations   but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying   and rely purely on luck   rather than audience pleasing skill    plot elements are introduced into the film   and then thrown away just as quickly    the main piece of the story   a 8-1 foot mechanical   steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive   but there s no particular reason why it should be built    why not loveless build a great big tank   instead of an ungainly   fragile piece of machinery that s just begging to be blown up    director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them   with some nice camera tricks   but even this is missing from this stilted affair    wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing   but not much of it is evident   making this film drag out even more    it s a sad thing when  four    credited   screenwriters   a talented director and a willing star can t make a film work   and eventually wild wild west collapses under it s sexist   mildly racist   unfunny weight    ,-1
 what were they thinking    nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough   but do we really need an eighties film    robbie hart   adam sandler   used to want to be a rock and roll star   but in 1985 he s singing at weddings and having a good time    a romantic at heart   he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high school sweetie    when she leaves him waiting at the altar   his tune changes to   love stinks      he meets waitress julia   drew barrymore   who is engaged to a junk bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together    in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie    sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role   but there is no spark    barrymore doesn t seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it   beauty but no attitude    both characters are just there    bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show    the eighties are shoved in our face    references to deloreans   madonna     dallas     ivana and donald   burt and loni and   miami vice   get old fast    the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn t much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions    they re not funny and it doesn t work    with change on all fronts accelerating more and more   nostalgia appears to have a great appeal   but don t you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past    maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino       michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be      ,-1
 and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners   not rating anything lower than your standard   this movie sucks     along comes this cinematic atrocity and he s forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick   even the bravest movie goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time    yes   despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie   the latest highlander doesn t seem to have anything going for it    oh stinky movie   let me count thee ways        plot     from what i understood   a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal       or  something along those lines    critique   a complete and utter mess    disjointed   incoherent   boring   corny   filled with bad dialogue       and  that s just the first thirty minutes !  this film doesn t seem to know what to do with itself    it s confusing to anyone who doesn t know the series   i include myself in that group   and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series   i include die hard highlander fan the arrow in that group      the film doesn t explain anything about itself       it  just goes from one inexplicable situation to another    one moment they re in the present time   the next moment   they re in italy in the 16-1-1s    why    who knows    what are they talking about    no idea    flashbacks mixed in with the present   mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again   and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! !  hullo         !    confused yet    i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story    random swordplay   mad max like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 18-1-1s    or were they in the present at that time    who knows       and to be honest       who  seriously cares !  this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago   but sadly   someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it    please   please       for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie making   and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film   put this series to bed and end it !  even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one    the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material   but all he could come up with is plenty of slo mo action   some fast motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere    and is there anything spectacular about the sword play or fight scenes    nope    and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close ups       yipes    the man is not aging gracefully   is he    oh boy   and i haven t even gotten around to the greatest piece of over acting that i ve seen in years    the man who plays kell in this movie   bruce payne   should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near    overacting is not a hobby for this guy       it s  a living !  he s also very funny   not pur1ely though    all in all   the movie stinks    nuff said    ,-1
 `bats  is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan    to pull something like this off   you need to have a sense of wit and style   with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines    something like the underground worm thriller `tremors  had just the perfect mixture of these elements   and in return   the film was tremendous fun    with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player   `bats  mainly plays it s premise for straight arrow horror    judging by the ridiculous premise   this was not exactly a wise move    the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock s `the birds    but fails miserably    done right   it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema    unfortunately   `bats  is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly   terribly wrong    the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be    i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats  is aimed toward    those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats    these bats are not very nice   because they eat a lot of people    boy   are these bats ugly    they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super duper smart    they ve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all    a whole bunch of people in texas get killed   so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats    they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with   but the bats are pretty smart   so it s sorta hard to do    the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good    but no   `bats  is probably too violent for pre schoolers    the film   directed by louis morneau   should have ventured straight into video stores    on the small screen   perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations    but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward   although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure   the film is poorly written   poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude    even the bats themselves are cheesy   and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed    the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey   lou diamond phillips     who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small town authority figure usually portrays   he chomps on a cigar   struts contentedly in his boots   etc            the scientist is dr   sheila casper   dina meyer     who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field     meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable   but everything about dr   casper is recycled beyond recognition    her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper s tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws     everything revolving around `bats  is tired drivel   which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up    the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw   with voices dubbed in later    in fact   that may have worked out better in the end    take one glance at casper s bat loathing sidekick jimmy   leon     and you ll have immediate deja vu   he s the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie   constructed specifically for timed comic relief    unfortunately   none of his comic interludes are funny    in the role of deranged mad scientist dr   mccabe   the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch    mccabe `accidentally  released two experimental test subjects   and the virus spread to other bats    the entire town of gallup   texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures   but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else    something like   `when is the damn movie going to be over      i just want my money      the bats are ugly   i must say    there s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing   but mainly   the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery    only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been   but by the absurdly stupid climax   it s way too late in the game for a decent recovery    characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire    let s explore the logic there   is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population      you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one   and after that there are only 18   -1-1-1 more of them    this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats     ,-1
 the most interesting part of   can t hardly wait   just happens to be not only the most human   but for many of us   the one part that many of us can easily relate to    that is the character of denise   lauren ambrose     the film s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film   and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored    the film wisely holds over this moment   nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party       almost  too nicely    for some members of the audience   read   me     this is basically a mirror of what s going on with them watching this film    we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place    i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this    after all   this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with    everyone s here   the jock   the homecoming queen   the nerd   and his dominions of trekkies and x philes     the alienated wannabe writer   the school spirit girl   the pothead   s     the wigger   etc   etc   etc   and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial   lame   and basically as a bunch of losers    except for denise   who rolls her eyes at everything   and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks   her yearbook entry   something which is done for each main character   quotes oscar wilde   definite pointers there      unfortunately   the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film    the film   as i said   portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything    however   instead of sticking with this   perhaps even going a bit further with it   they let this lie   and actually make these characters into our heroes    we follow several of them   all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism   and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them    and if we did   we certainly don t want to revisit that state of being    here s a quick low down   it s graduation   and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night   otherwise known as the   american grafitti   or   to a lesser extent   the   dazed and confused   cliche    the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly   the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party       can t hardly wait   just opts for a big indoor keg party   and a little bit of aimless driving   albeit of the i m whining because i can t get a girl i want brand    we follow many people around   but mostly we trail preston   ethan embry   of   that thing you do !       the alienated writer   who s been pining over the homcoming queen   amanda   the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt     for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart    now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend   mike   peter facinelli     he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his   love   for her in the hopes he ll build up the guts to give it to her       even  though he s leaving for a multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt von-1ut   okay   the ingenius von-1ut or some icky noxema spokesperson        since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film   and because it s a party   there are some more main characters   such as   william   charlie korsmo   finally surfacing after   dick tracy       the nerd   and his dominions   who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike   who s humiliated him for years   but gets too caught up in drinking to do it   kenny   seth green     the wigger   who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid   uh huh     and denise   the only exceptional character   who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom   don t ask   with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile    ugh    the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not   american grafitti   or   dazed and confused     two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers   not to mention were extremely entertaining     but to john hughes films of the 8-1s   most notably   sixteen candles      the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters   and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion    this film forgets to satirize its characters   and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes       and  then says that it s all okay    we can t take this film seriously   nor can we take this as fun   so really what good is it    but i will tell you some things i did like   i liked the direction   except for a couple too over the top features   like way too glossy jump cuts   it s like an oxymoron   and other obscurities    generally   though   elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement   and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time   a thing with a note   though   is too hokey to really be admirable      i actually did like seth green   for once in about a decade   when he played a very young woody allen in   radio days       his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable       almost    and   of course   lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise   the one character we could have used some more of   even though it would have changed the entirety of the film    however   the character of denise really doesn t work with the film   when really thought about    she s far too witty and realized   at least for the first half   to belong in this film   and whenever she appears   she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone    she s not just the cynic or the intellectual   she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters    she may ruin the film more   but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves   well   at least we ll be entertained      a couple other things that just don t work   mike s character   who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything   too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general   the aimless   bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda   give me a break   and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all   jenna eflman s uncredited cameo as an angel   just didn t work   but nice try    basically the worst thing about this film   the real reason i m giving this such a low rating   is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we d do    we don t feel for these characters because for most of us   we aren t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots    the acid test for high school movies is   does it at all capture the feel of what it s portraying    the answer for this film is no    nice try   though    ,-1
 the film may be called mercury rising   but that title doesn t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture   a routine thriller that combines government cover ups with a cloying and poorly motivated buddy story    the   hook   that is sup1ed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic    however   aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance   this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device    those expecting to see even a semi thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed    mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism    the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard  to swallow    i don t know whether the problem is in the original book   simple simon   or in the screenplay adaptation   but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer 1sible    once again   certain standby plot elements    the high level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent    are recycled   and not to good effect    while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood   this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense    the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold   art jeffries   bruce willis     is confronted with his own failure    unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time   he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death    the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9 year old simon lynch   miko hughes   when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player    soon   art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone    fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time   with the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player always just a step behind them    along the way   they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy   chi mcbride   and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest   kim dickens      why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player    apparently   the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra secret code called   mercury      to make sure it can t be cracked   they do the most intuitive thing 1sible   place a sample of it in a   nerds  puzzle magazine      of course   no one can solve it    no one except autistic simon   that is    when he calls the phone number listed in the solution   he gets the nsa    as a result   the cold hearted   sneering government man   alec baldwin   decides that simon has to be eliminated    for the good of the country   of course    but he hasn t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold   even though everyone in the audience has    it s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn t do anything exceptionally well   and does quite a few things rather poorly    for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like   mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time to time   but even the most exciting scenes   such as the one where art and simon are crouched down   avoiding passing trains   aren t that pulse pounding    the climactic struggle is a real ho hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness    overall   director harold becker is constantly struggling   and failing   to generate even a moment that isn t derivative or obligatory    bruce willis  star seems to be fading    this is his fourth straight lackluster outing   following last man standing   the fifth element   and the jackal    willis isn t terrible   but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through   and often does    alec baldwin   combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice   does some scenery  chewing   but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace    the film s real star is young miko hughes   heather langenkamp s son in wes craven s new nightmare     who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual   but is about 5-1 years younger    mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain   the replacement killers   and u   s   marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers    for those who like action and adventure in the theater   this has not been a good year    hopefully   the advent of summer will change that    until then   the best choices   for bruce willis or any other action hero   are on video    and   if you re determined to see mercury rising   check out the morning sky in early may    ,-1
    alcohol and drugs = bad    not alcohol and drugs = good    got it      just when you though you ve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen   be that insanity or alcoholism   hollywood releases yet another one of those  deep   emotional stories about finding yourself        28 days  is practically a visualization of the usual  meaningful  true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa meetings    gwennie   sandra bullock   is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol    for her life was a big party   with no beginning and no end    this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself    her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes    such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper   dominic west     borrowed her sister s   elizabeth perkins   wedding limo and crashed it into someone s house    this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court ordered rehab    here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption   willpower and commitment    most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party    the film itself feels like a rehab program   whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times    it is a classic cautionary tale    an echo    a big   fat and expensive clich      a shadow of last year s  girl   interrupted    which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like  the cuckoo s nest  and  trainspotting     director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors   that it is im1sible to sum them all up in one review    for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy    jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues   alienation   despair   terror   confusion   loneliness    and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean    isn t that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place    even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park   betty thomas  idea of hell is a cozy   homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke   drink or watch tv after 11    it is simply too light   simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously    but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance    that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story       all you need to do is just say no     says dr   cornell   steve buscemi   as if was the revelation of the century    and that s how simple it is !  in fact i would rather watch  lost in space  once again   than return to  28 days     as for acting   it s acceptable   but hardly anything else    for sandra bullock it s an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than  speed     she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop    dominic west shines as the source of gwenie s devilish temptations   but elizabeth perkins  and steve buscemi s great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters    although intellectually  girl   interrupted  was a greater achievement    28 days  is superior in its visual aspect    there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing   but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor    the most important thing is that we ve seen it before and it was a lot better     clean and sober     only when i laugh     when a man loves a woman     leaving las vegas  and many other stronger films were made about the same issues    so what s the point    in other words  28 days  doesn t contribute to the moviemaking business on any level    if you re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you re standing in front of the movie theatre   you might as well go in and watch  28 days     under all other circumstances stay away   because this film equals $8 and 1-13 minutes lost    ,-1
 capsule   combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark   a dash of a jackie chan movie   sans jackie     two teaspoons of gun  and swordplay   and a dollop of cgi    simmer for 1-1-1 minutes    yields   zilch    the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier   better movies that after the fifteen minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud    it s hard to make a good action adventure movie that doesn t simply recycle its predecessors   and i ve seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully    the phantom   allegedly based on the long running comic of the same name   doesn t even bother to be graceful    it s a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list   but i ll try    the film opens up with a   prelude   sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice over to compensate for whatever got thrown out    we go from there to a jungle sequence that   i swear to god   recycles the truck chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note for note   1sibly even shot for shot   right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush    and then goes on to rip off the rope bridge scene from   sorcerer   as well !  sorcerer   as you may well remember   was a remake of a french movie   the wages of fear   in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain    both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick   but i ve got my job to do   so back to the salt mines we go    anyway   the cinematic theft doesn t stop there    or at least the lack of inspiration    there isn t a single thing here we haven t seen   and it s not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest    we have   where s my list      a bad girl   a tough good girl   a secret cave hideaway   which seems inspired more by dr    no than anything else     a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality   magical artifacts of terrible power   and cary hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself    what else is there    the plot is a waste of time    the sets alternate between big but hokey    and tiny and still hokey    there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked    and i m sure once mike and the  bots get the cash   they ll stick it on their sked    the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane    he s a good actor   and he tries very hard   even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another    all i can say is that i pray this isn t the beginning of the end for him    although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic book super hero movie    ,-1
 a new entry in the   revisionist history   genre of filmmaking   dick suggests that two not too bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation s biggest presidential scandal    kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene   who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene s watergate hotel room   accidentally stumble across g   gordon liddy   played dead on by harry shearer   and the infamous break in    when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip   they are ushered into a conference room   questioned as to what they know   and leave as official presidential dog walkers    the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties   but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with    when they discover that nixon   another dead on performance by dan hedaya   who actually favors nixon slightly   unlike anthony hopkins   has been abusive to checkers   the presidential dog   thanks to the conversations that he always recorded   they quit and become disillusioned    during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein   events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president s resignation    this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king type talk show   featuring a cameo by french stewart   about revealing the identity of   deep throat      from there   we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad   dick   joke one can derive from this type of sup1ed comedy    at one point   the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial    the band manages to stop right as dunst screams   you have to stop letting dick run your life !    much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot    several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film    if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it s juvenile bathroom humor   but it s not    the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience s throat in the least subtle way 1sible    i don t recall oliver stone s nixon having to pander to it s audience   but of course that film wasn t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13 2-1 year old film going audience    the only redeeming thing about this movie is it s remarkable supporting cast    i wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch s woodward and bernstein    those two characters are the sole basis for my rating    i wish they had been given more screen time   but unfortunately   they are only relegated to the final half hour    their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight   especially mcculloch s constant thwarting of ferrell s attempts to gather information from the girls   who   in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat   so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy s brother      the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters   but are given nothing to work with    i d like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities    as for the two leads   dunst and williams can definitely do better    they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele   the early years in this particular film   a highly dubious distinction at best    stay through the first half of the end credits though   to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie    an excellent idea marred by poor execution   dick could have been a great movie    less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes   could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds    as it stands though   dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as   dick and poopie   jokes    and that   to me   does not make a funny movie    [pg 13]  ,-1
 words i thought i d never write   the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace   wit   and power of the original    put the gun to my head   pull the trigger   and put me out of my misery    better yet   put the horror genre out of its misery    when you ve finished watching urban legends   final cut   you ll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting   terrible script   and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today    urban legends   final cut is a smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas   mainly from the blair witch project and scream     fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin   one creepy film school   and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of the movie s hapless victims    urban legends delivers a story about a bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted   hitchcock award   which guarantees the winner a director deal in hollywood    one female filmmaker   jennifer morrison   the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes   writes a fiction script based on a serial killer who kills his victims according to   urban legend   tales    suddenly   her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urban legendary homicides   but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings    the killer wears a fencing mask and a long black overcoat   looking like a scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney    why this is scary is never explained    of course   the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuity s sake    urban legends has one minor   recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway   the security guard   of all people      the other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before   but she s utterly clueless about what s going on around her    call it suspension of disbelief    this film is also a prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water    the last decent horror film was the blair witch project   and that seemed more like a snuff film than fiction    the stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich     as everyone seems to have forgotten   real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown    ,-1
 godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the   who cares about plot   summer movie    a loose remake of the 1954   classic   japanese monster movie   godzilla   king of the monsters   which is itself pretty thin in the story department     roland emmerich and dean devlin s big budget lizard stomps manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind    the script isn t just   dumbed down     it s lobotomized    godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone    presumably   the primary target group for this film is teenage boys   the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster instigated carnage    that s not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction   they re just not as readily susceptible    this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors    stargate was a financial success    independence day was a runaway hit    and   with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie ins before it even opens   it s virtually guaranteed at least $1-1-1 million    nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not too precocious grade school kid    godzilla isn t completely without merit   although it is close    there s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan   but it wears off quickly    frankly   while the special effects are competent   they re not all that stunning    there s nothing new here   it s jurassic park meets aliens   with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure    maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer generated visuals to the next level    godzilla never really pushes the envelope   preferring to remain within a comfort zone    the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass   formulaic approach which disallows creativity       how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival      worst of all   godzilla isn t even exciting    with the 1sible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end   there isn t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse    even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn provoking    independence day may have been dumb   but it was full of   adrenaline moments   capable of getting the audience involved in the action    in this aspect of its production   as in so many others   godzilla is lacking    actually   part of the problem is that we re never sure who we re sup1ed to be rooting for   the green monster with an attitude or the paper thin humans trying to stop him    the plot   such as it is   can be summed up rather simply    after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands   godzilla shows up in the big apple    he does some of the usual tourist things   stops by madison square garden   visits the chrysler building   goes on a walk through central park   and takes the subway    in the process   he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs   but he never has trouble with traffic jams    on hand to stop him is an elite u   s   army unit   led by a slightly less arrogant than usual military man   kevin dunn   and a biologist named nick tatopoulos   who has a theory about godzilla    in his opinion   the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific    in nick s words   godzilla is   a mutated aberration   an incipient creature   the first of its kind      as luck would have it   nick s old girlfriend   audrey   maria pitillo     is a reporter based at a new york tv station    along with her cameraman friend   animal   hank azaria     she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla    then   just when the military has rejected nick s theory about why godzilla is in new york   a member of the french secret service   jean reno   recruits him for a special assignment    instead of stomping around tokyo this time   godzilla has chosen new york city    unfortunately   manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies   independence day   deep impact   armageddon   that it s becoming boring    the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong   but the big ape was only about 3-1 feet tall    he could climb the empire state building    at ten times that height   godzilla would be more likely to knock it over    godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor    there s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit com material   an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick s last name properly   and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel    both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film     ebert     the mayor of new york   is played by michael lerner   and   gene     lorry goldman   is his campaign manager    ebert s re election slogan is   not surprisingly     thumbs up for new york      the siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it s used   but   after a while   it grows tiresome    and   although the   characters   don t serve any real pur1e   they keep popping up    godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast    this is largely because emmerich doesn t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard    that s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren t capable of good performances   both have done their share of solid acting in the past     but they aren t a list names    then again   considering the quality of the writing   even pacino and deniro would have been hard  pressed to shine    maria pitillo   dear god   plays the love interest and hank azaria   great expectations   is on hand to present what is sup1ed to be comic relief    ultimately   it doesn t really matter what i   or any other critic   for that matter   have to say about the movie    tristar has assumed that godzilla   like all self proclaimed summer event motion pictures   is pretty much critic proof    it may also be word of mouth proof    those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say    so   when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time   it s like spitting into the wind    emmerich and devlin are master illusionists   waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors    it s probably too much to hope that some day   movie goers will wake up and realize that they ve been had    ,-1
 recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn t sleep    he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour    then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food    then he took down a volume of shakespeare s work and read it cover to cover   never really paying attention to the words or plot    and then   as a climax   he took out his video camera and pressed the   on   button    the result    william shakespeare s romeo + juliet   the worst film ever made and a complete failure    though   to be fair   an interesting complete failure    the idea at the film s core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds    this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can t see what is going on    and filming the dialogue in voice over    and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model    and making the frame go still while flashing the character s name at the bottom    and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion    i mean   man   this is the 9-1s   dude    however i ve seen terrible films that are fun to watch       examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau       that rule doesn t apply here    this is a film that takes itself seriously    that is it s major fault    another problem was pointed out by my friend   alex   who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout         the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didn t take sides    here it s clear that we are sup1ed to side with romeo       just look at the way they film him       from the begining he s our hero and this doesn t work    and dicaprio s awful performance doesn t help    luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us    the result is a mess    you can feel him striving to be something he isn t    he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from pur1efully arty angles    he tries very hard    key word   tries       oh look   he s filming above water action from below    pretty    what does it represent      why do people do ugly things    i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face    ,-1
 in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures    of course what constitutes a crisis differs from person to person    what may be a disastrous situation for one   may be seen as a challenge to another    as deepak chopra is known to say     it s not the ride   it s the rider      unfortunately clear thinking is not always the reaction to problems    wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor   michael douglas   is a man with troubles    he s sunk his money in illegal financial activities and it s blown up in his face    in a matter of days he will lose it all    his wife emily   gwyneth paltrow   is a highly placed un interpreter and is not happy with her life either    her marriage is cold and unfulfilling    unknown to her   her new lover david shaw   viggo mortensen   is not only a painter   but an ex con with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money    emily is a prime target   she s worth over $1-1-1 million    steven s solution to his predicament is to offer david half a million to kill his wife    the artist accepts and the movie is underway    drawing from frederick knott s play and loosely based on hitchcock s dial m for murder   this is all too typical of summer releases    all style and no substance    and there s really not much style    director andrew davis   the accomplished witness and best forgotten other films   has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn    douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films    mortensen showed promise in the past    here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces    the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman    he s only on screen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears    the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense    surprises are important    in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen    and nothing ever does    nearly every event is telegraphed in advance    close up on this object or that action and it s easy to guess what s going to happen    as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile    it s a hopeless quest    the story doesn t make much sense    steven s wife is loaded    even with unfriendly relations   you d think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her    when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice    if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife   would your first choice be her lover    no matter how sleazy he is   i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity    why would steven plan the murder as a break in in their apartment    why not just take her out as she was walking to david s loft in a bad neighborhood    while deciding among the numerous summer films   you might do well to skip this one    you ll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel    ,-1
    virus   is a monster movie without a monster    any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise    sadly     virus   does not deliver   on any level    the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something   we never find out what   to a big boat with lots of satellites on it    sudddenly   a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space   and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat    cut to seven days later   we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures    see   they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead in the water ships to rescue   and then collect the reward money    at least   i * think * that s what they do    along with many other things in the film   their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn t really explained    so   they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it   and decide to haul it back to russian waters    the only problem is   the crew starts disappearing one by one and turning into borg    yes   borg    complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye    apparently   this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical    so   it creates make shift machines and uses humans for   spare parts      blah   blah   blah    i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so called plot   but i won t    suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man   !      everything else in this movie has been taken from other   better   movies    for example   many of the machines resemble those found in the little seen japanese movie     tetsuo the iron man      and the plot is right out of   aliens      the funny thing is   i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie    i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies   like last years under appreciated   deep rising      but   virus     as i mentioned earlier   doesn t even have a monster    it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption       virus   is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it    besides the lame   monster     it s chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say   and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into    for example   there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * -1otiate * with the alien !  now   i don t know about you   but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated   i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it    that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life    finally     virus   isn t scary    the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary    as it is   it s about as frightening as a box of cookies    skip   virus      if it s a cool monster movie you want   rent the far superior   and the granddaddy of this genre     aliens      ,-1

 barb wire   pamela anderson lee s first foray into films   highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets    being the only notable member of the cast   the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity   making her character s catch line     don t call me babe     sound very ironic indeed    from the very opening of the movie   we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson   ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe    throughout the movie   there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage   if not of anderson s   then at least of the female extras    this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire    for a plot   barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline    it is 2-117   the middle of the second american civil war   and barb wire   a former resistance fighter   runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead   ! !      known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts   the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi style uniforms    in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts   barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town   past the government controlled areas   and to freedom    even the airport looks like the one in casablanca   except that the plane in the background is a modern   private jet    there are hardly any significant moments in this film   and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of   barb wire      if anything   one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts    who could fight and jump in a skimpy   strapless leather top   and yet keep her breasts from spilling out    only a stuntwoman    not pamela anderson lee    ,-1
 humanities quest for knowledge never ends    so a team of scientists and film makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe    the party consists of anthropologist steven cale   eric stoltz   and the camera team consisting of terri flores   jennifer lopez     danny rich   ice cube     gary dixon   owen wilson     denise kahlberg   kari wuhrer   and warren westridge   jonathan hyde      early on their journey they meet paul sarone   jon voight   whose boat is stuck on the shore    they agree to give him a ride to the next village    he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe    very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo    we don t have to wait too long for the giant snake    she just had a panther hors d oevre and now is looking for the main course    our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard    no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell    our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp    enjoy !  so much for the first attempt to catch her    but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole    our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake    too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition    one by one she goes after the others    eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure    the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned    however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring    whenever the leading lady shows up we re in for a laugh    the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe inspiring monster    her attacks always follow the same plan   one last hypnotic look   she s looking at you   kid   then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down    mostly we don t see the act of devouring    but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part    whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes    maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real    the animatronics are somewhat more believable    but that didn t work for the strangling scenes    don t go see the movie for the f/x    they are everything but up to date    the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team    we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work    a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits   but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation    the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling   anyway    what kind of audience is the target group for this movie    hard to say    this can t be a serious horror movie   or can it    see for yourself    ,-1
 absolute power   the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood   attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff    it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper    one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood    not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived   but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence    continually underestimating the audience   the film gives us information we already know or dont even need    details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying   like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night vision goggles in their car        oddly enough   the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting 1sibilities    a masterful jewel thief   played by clint eastwood   witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire   played by e   g    marshall      while robbing one of marshalls mansions   he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault    there   through a two way mirror   he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay    their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman    in self defense   the woman grabs a letter opener and stabs the man in the elbow    she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men    the man    he is the president of the united states of america    where does the film go wrong    it cannot be the acting    clint eastwood   ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type cast   but decent performances    the cinematography is sufficient   wild and erratic during action sequences   dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes   and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue    even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre    the fault clearly lies in the screenplay   and the screenplay alone    while setting up a story about misuse of power   about the true 1sessors of that power   and about intrigue and double crossing   it does not resolve it    not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax    rather   the tense situations are left dangling at the end   giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness    an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene   in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood   the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant    police officers are everywhere   incognito of course    at the same time   not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives    all three parties are unaware of each others presence    this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood   who might suspect this is a trap   will get himself out of this difficult 1ition    he will probably have a brilliant plan   involving ingenious preparations    however   when he arrives at the trap   both hit men miss   how convenient   and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away    the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes    ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap    the scene was resolved in less than 2-1 seconds        parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter    the daughter blames her father for never being there for her   because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere    of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family    again   it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot    however   trying is simply not enough !  the second story line should be subtle   original and preferably unpredictable        everything this film is not    how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced    how could eastwood   who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven   ever believe in a project like this one    i am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film    director quentin tarantino once said     i can make a good movie out of any bad script      director clint eastwood obviously cannot    ,-1

 the crown jewel of 197-1 s irwin allen disaster movies   the 1eidon adventure features an all star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship    the story begins on the u   s   s    1eidon s big new year s cruise   where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive    let s see   there s the new age preacher   hackman   who advises people to   pray to that part of god within yourself      there s the ex cop   borgnine   who busted a hooker   stella stevens   six times    then married her    there s the hippie singer     there s got to be a morning after           who turns to the company of a lonely man   red buttons   once her brother is killed    and to round out the group   the elderly couple   jack albertson and shelley winters   who live aboard the ship   the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall    we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the 1eidon adventure   before straight  faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship    everyone s in the giant ballroom at the time   shortly past midnight of the new year   when the ship turns first on its side   then completely upside down    the second  in command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives   but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship    in this case   because the ship is overturned   the top is the bottom    or is the bottom the top    either way   we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and    in the ballroom scene    christmas trees    thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors   through burning rooms   etc   while the ship slowly fills with water behind them    it s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting    the 1eidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at   with all the melodrama that comes in between the non thrilling action scenes    the one note in borgnine s one note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love   although since there isn t a sex scene   we never find out if his buttons really are red   and albertson and winters wonder if they ll live to see their grandson s birth    shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end   where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along    winters   who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie   stevens even not so  affectionately calls her   fatass   in one scene     finally finds her pur1e       i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen     she brags   and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years   she s swimming through the water   her skirt billowing up around her hips   showing off her cellulite   or do you call it shellulite      ridden thighs    it s not so much funny as innately disgusting   which pretty much sums up the 1eidon adventure as a whole    ,-1
 while watching loser   it occurred to me that amy heckerling s true genius as a film maker is casting    in fast times at ridgemont high   she gave us sean penn s jeff spicoli   in look who s talking   she turned bruce willis into a wise cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival   in clueless   she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is   or was   alicia silverstone    she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws    unfortunately   she may also be starting to understand that she understands    giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies    giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal  is  the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser    naturally   heckerling makes her protagonist an all around swell guy    paul tannek   jason biggs   is a small town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu   then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold hearted big city    paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman   his roommates adam   zak orth     chris   tom sadoski   and noah   jimmi simpson   are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul    paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar   in this case the lovely dora diamond   mena suvari      dora has problems of her own   including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor   edward alcott   greg kinnear     that s more than slightly one sided    they re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people   so clearly they belong together   even if paul is a loser    i must confess that   for a while   i was suckered in by heckerling s casting    jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace   suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence    they re pleasant enough to watch   and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren t    then it gradually becomes clear that there s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort    in theory   loser is a romantic comedy   but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film   notable exception   a cameo by a scene stealing comic actor as a video store clerk      instead of taking any time to make the characters  situations funny   heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters  situations pathetic    she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless   nor any of that film s interest in lively plotting   not surprisingly   since clueless s plot came via jane austen s emma      she simply turns the film into a pity party    since loser is a film com1ed almost entirely of establishing character   you might think that those characters would be interesting   or at least slightly complicated    instead   you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there s no reason to watch them    paul isn t just a nice guy   he s flawless   consequently   he s a central character who does absolutely no growing    his roommates aren t just inconsiderate   they re actively evil blackmailing professor alcott   drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name    and professor alcott isn t just manipulative   he turns dora into his house slave    dora s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser   and even that isn t explored in sufficient detail    there s more ambiguity in the 3-1 second snippet from alan cumming s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations   it s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush    and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow        i don t know        comic    still   i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora    that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel s   scarborough fair/canticle      instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink a reference to the graduate   a hint that paul is becoming an overly sensitive clich heckerling plays it deadly straight    even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist s foibles   she finds it im1sible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint    clueless s cher had her self absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness    in loser   amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness   her one show of wit involves naming paul s dorm   hunt s hall   after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall      her gift with casting proved to be her curse    loser may be a crashing bore   but gee   aren t those two kids swell    ,-1

  bicentennial man  is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment    chris columbus   the director who gave you   mrs   doubtfire     plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point    based on the short story by isaac asimov   it is sup1ed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human   which as you can imagine is very difficult    starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children    soon this robot   called andrew   robin williams   shows abilities that makes his owner mr   martin   sam neill   very curious    andrew is interested in art and music   he   enjoys   making clocks   which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions    it shows out that because of a small failure in the   electrical circuits   and   1itronic brain   andrew has accidentally gained a soul    this makes him unique and his evil creators worried    then mr   martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn t programmed to do    soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom   destiny and love    this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner   a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction    ever since that film   the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy    what makes us human    the thoughts    the emotions    is it 1sible to become human    at what point can we say to a robot   now you are one of us      these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach    it is obvious that columbus didn t take them very seriously    when you think about it   this film is not really meditating on the question   when is a robot no longer a machine   but a human being       but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding    andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being   and only the society has troubles with it    in other words   it is as far from reality as from the academy awards    further more   there are other annoying problems    to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 5-1 years from now    this has not been done for obvious reasons   because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task    columbus is the first to have crossed that line    the result is   as you might imagine   primitive   unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort    the world is simply frozen in time    neither the society   fashion   culture or values have changed over 2-1-1 years    mom is still working at the kitchen   doing the dishes    when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today   you ll see a slightly bigger difference    i am not saying that everything should change    it is unlikely that the human rights will change   but it s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science   technology and fashion    i sup1e it s 1sible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale   but it s really hard    robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way    as always he does a decent job   as does sam neill    but it doesn t really matter    it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience    pretty much like last year s   meet joe black     this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn t deserve    great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten    when isaac asimov wrote this story   the future seemed far away and magical    everything seemed 1sible    now is the future of asimov s time   and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago    for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne s   2-1 -1-1-1 leagues under the sea     so can t we accept this story as a potential reality    let us hope that next year s   a   i      will be more rewarding    ,-1
 in the continuation of warner brother s franchise   joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow    what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film    avika goldsman s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another    this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as   the client   is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke    situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another    this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone s batgirl   who just happens to be alfred s niece    the story of dr   victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought    while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife   dr   freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure   and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment    now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live    now the logic of that little sub plot escapes me    if mr   freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death   why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth    this is indeed a cold hearted man    the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory    she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal    she joins with mr   freeze in his plan to start a new ice age   destroying all animal life   therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them    the characters have no logic    batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films    now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin   bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure   constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships   while at the same time not really having any    george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him    to say that his performance is workman like is to be generous    his best performances are still on   e   r        bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend   played by elle macpherson     that it brings into question bruce s latent homosexuality    there is no spark and no passion   as there was for nicole kidman s psychologist in   batman forever     between bruce and anyone other than alfred    and even that relationship is very reserved    robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series    now he s just a spoiled kid    in   batman forever     burt ward wanted to be batman s partner and friend    now   robin is suffering from ego deficiency    robin s attraction for poison ivy is not believable   except for a boy around the age of 15    his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest   even though they are not related in a traditional sense    chris o donnell   once considered a rising star   successfully burns up on reentry with this performance    his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking    the less said about alicia silverstone s performance the better    this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film    she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it    this brings us to the villains    arnold scharze-1ger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday    the most rediculous scene is during mr   freeze s imprisonment    the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film    it s almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member    umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part   showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status    her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in   sextette     1978      the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough    these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film    without going through the intricacies of the plot   there is one question that always comes to mind with this series   except for the first   batman       and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel    mr   freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video    every villain   even the minor ones   have to have a look   no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume    with this film   warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it s tv incarnation    the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superim1ed titles detailing the pows !    gwaaaa s   and clang s associated with the old series    you almost wonder if william dozier   producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film    the special effects   by john dykstra   and production design   by barbara ling   are the primary stars of this film    and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing    every set   from ivy s lair   the batcave   to freeze s hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come    there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film    everything is set for maximum ex1ure    the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have    there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on   the time machine     the growing plant scene   but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured    joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair    camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series    master shots pepper the action scenes   destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had    mr   schumacher is a good director    one just has to look back on the films   the lost boys       cousins     an underrated film   and   the client   to know that    but   batman and robin   comes off as a mated made for tv movie    the film has no style of individuality    it is the cinematic equivalent to jell o   pretty to look at   but empty    it is unfortunate that this film   even with it s surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner s thought tim burton would do with the franchise    kill it    joel schumacher s   batman & robin   is loud   colorful   action packed   and ultimately      boring    stars    ,-1
 long ago   films were constructed of strong dialogue   original characters   memorable plot points   and solid acting    one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is    this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic   and i mean tragic   life of novalee nation   natalie portman      hitting the road with her hick   guitar playing boyfriend in a rusted out gm   novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby   due in a month    stopping off at a nearby wal mart for a quick rest   novalee s boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there    novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal mart   because she s not the brightest bulb in the stagelights      a wacky librarian   keith david   comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store    then the she moves in with a family   befriends everyone in town    including ashley judd s character   who has five kids and still can work part time as a nurse      fights off religious freaks   survives a tornado   breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her   receives an inheritance   builds a martha stewart esque house   becomes an award winning photographer   and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot   all while not once doing anything with her kid    this film is terrible    the directing is awful   it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them   over and over and over again    we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman   who can do good work    a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off    a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal mart parking lot    an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters   making the audience ill    taking two great comedic screenwriters   babaloo mandel and lowell ganz   and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah s book club    altogether   it has the feeling of being trapped at home   watching a very bad television mini series and wishing it to end   only the remote is broken    however   the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up   where is the heart    no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk    ,-1
 stars   armand assante   mike hammer     barbara carrera   dr    charlotte bennett     laurene landon   velda     alan king   charles kalecki     geoffrey lewis   joe butler     paul sorvino   detective pat chambers     judson scott   charles hendricks     barry snider   romero     julia barr   norma childs   / mpaa rating   r / review    in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane s 1947 novel   i   the jury     hard boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am   dresses like don johnson in   miami vice   with less pastels   and has sworn off alcohol    however   he still smokes his lucky strikes   detests all forms of authority   and kills at a whim    beyond that   the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page turner by spillane   probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers    the movie starts off with a bang   a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series   complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti     rocky        after that   the movie and the book begin the same   with the murder of jack williams   frederick downs     a one armed detective and hammer s best friend    hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack s death   and with the help of his devoted secretary   the blond and shapely velda   laurene landon     and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers   paul sorvino     he is immediately on the killer s trail    here the movie splits completely from the book   and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia   the cia   one of hammer s vietnam vet buddies   and a kinky sex clinic    many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie   but they take on slightly different roles    for instance   charles kalecki   alan king     a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book   turns into a suave mob boss    and   more importantly   hammer s suspicious love interest   charlotte bennett   barbara carrera     morphs from a run of the mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic       i   the jury   is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane s books   including a 1953 version which was made in 3 d     but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way   it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood s production code    although this takes the 1982 version of   i   the jury   closer to the core of the original subject matter   it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism   because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book    rest assured   the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity   but it is thoroughly violent   especially toward women    it features one woman having her neck slashed   a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia   judson scott     and another woman shot point blank in the belly by hammer himself    no one would deny that spillane s writing has a definite misogynistic nature   but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment   its constant equation of sex and violence   much of which is played with the intention of being erotic   is quite unsettling    it s no surprise that the movie   like the book   fades to black with a dead woman on the floor       i   the jury   had a troubled production and was not well supported by the studio that made it   which is one explanation why it didn t do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made    the script was written by larry cohen   who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies   like   it s alive     1974   and its two sequels     q     1981     and   the stuff     1985      cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well   but he was yanked from the director s chair after only a week s worth of shooting because he was already $1-1-1   -1-1-1 over budget    he was quickly replaced by richard t   heffron   who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects    heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent   but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently    it shows in the final product    cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer   but heffron has none    he shot the movie quickly and clumsily   and although some scenes ring true   most of them are flat   trite   and invariably dull    the movie features numerous car chases   shoot outs   and stunts   but heffron s background in television is the dominant tone   despite the graphic violence and full frontal nudity     i   the jury     takes on the air of a made for tv quickie   with no real punch or depth    but the problems in   i   the jury   run deeper than the technical    the central fault in this updating is mike hammer   whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties    because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person   hammer s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona    we never really get that impression in the movie    there is no first person voice over narration and some scenes don t have hammer in them at all    consequently   a great deal of the texture of spillane s storytelling is lost    the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer s moral code is thrown to the wind    despite his characterization as a hard nosed   violent   misogynistic killer   hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code    the title itself     i   the jury     refers to his anti establishment notion of being his own law    unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police   hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment    in this way   he can be seen as   above the law     but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct   his own morality    the movie forgoes that aspect of his character   and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society s terms   but in any terms   especially his own    if anything   hammer always had his professionalism   but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful    maybe the scene was intended for laughs   but it only cheapens hammer s character and is   by all accounts   a lousy way to start the movie    the blame for hammer s character can t be laid on assante s shoulders   because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon like mumbling   he delivers a fine performance    spillane never once described hammer s physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared   so any actor could conceivably portray him    of course   because of the lack of written description   those who have read spillane s books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like   and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations   spillane   who played the character himself in 1963 s   the girl hunters     is generally considered the best of the film hammers      the rest of actors are most un noteworthy    with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino   everyone who appeared in   i   the jury   were up and comers who basically went nowhere    many of them ended up working in television   like carrera   who had a short stint on   dallas   in the mid eighties     which only adds to the made for tv atmosphere of the film    maybe someday   someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book   but this is certainly not it    ,-1
 nostalgia for the 7-1s continues   as we see a revival of one of the decade s greatest achievements   the marijuana comedy    however half baked doesn t quite run with all its brain cells   and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more    the plot follows the misadventures of four ne er do well stoners    there s the group s unofficial leader   thurgood   david chappelle     scarface   guillermo diaz     brian   jim breuer     and kenny   harland williams      kenny gets into trouble   when   while on a munchie run   feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse    when the animal keels over   he finds himself accused of killing a police officer   and facing a $1   -1-1-1   -1-1-1 bail    his friends promise to raise money for a 1-1% bail bond   but have no idea how    that is   until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor    soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds   while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson   clarence williams iii      for a comedy   the film is pretty humorless    not that it doesn t try       it s  just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat    the four leads are nearly all playing the same character    only williams stands out   while still performing on the level of his humor free comedy rocket man     but that is because he s imprisoned throughout most of the film   giving a much needed change of pace   but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another      to help out   the film is packed full of cameos    steven wright   tommy chong   janeane garofalo   willie nelson   snoop doggy dogg   and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another    none of them work   beyond the simple   hey   that s         level    in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle    not as his bland pothead lead   but in his second role   as a pot obsessed rapper   sir smokealot    granted   it s pretty much a one joke role   and there aren t a ton of laughs       but this film needs every one it can scrape up    to top it off   and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film   thurgood is given a love interest   mary jane   rachel true      her role is that of the public service announcement   to inform us why doing drugs   including pot   is wrong    her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the   your film promotes the use of drugs   camp    the film would have been better off by sticking with the   rebel   tone it so eagerly tries to claim    yet   in the end   it doesn t really matter    watching the film clean and sober   you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is    ,-1

 anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon s fact based novel the king and i   and it s big   expensive and soulless    though good looking   its lavish sets   fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson s script    so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting    this is jodie foster s first movie since the jaw droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn t the best choice to show off her acting chops    she s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens   the uptight   widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam   now thailand   with her son to instruct the king s   chow yun fat   son in the ways of the west   because   the ways of england are the ways of the world      the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family   58 kids with 1-1 more in the way   impressive   no        the eldest prince is none too happy about this     father   have i offended you in some way    why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher       but soon gets to know anna and her stern  mother who loves you personality better and comes to like her    meanwhile   siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma    the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain s doing which arouses suspicion in siam   putting anna in an uncomfortable 1ition    she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king s prejudices    he   though self righteous as ever   can t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly   quietly   develop affections for each other    there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king s younger daughters dies    it s your classic deathbed scene   with the girl s mournful eyes staring at her father   who tries only semi  successfully to maintain his com1ure    anna then comes in and cries a bit    the sequence was there for a pur1e   to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer    i m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time   i was just sitting there   my emotions untouched    this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren    we never develop connections to the characters   never given a reason to care    this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant   whose last film was ever after   one of my favorites of 1998    i do not doubt tennant s ability to put together a decent movie   but anna and the king   aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient    the sets and scenery are gorgeous   but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur    even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia    we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view   there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger than life awe    i liked both foster and yun fat   who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles    foster s generally stoic persona serves her well here   as she is playing a reserved   formal and rather underdeveloped character    yun fat is especially effective   perfectly conveying the king of siam s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts    what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations    the cast is great   the director is talented   and the budget is lavish   but this ill advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole    this is an emotionless costume epic    ,-1
 robin hood   men in tights is another mel brooks produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein    mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life   his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit    unfortunately   robin hood   men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles   none of the fun acting of young frankenstein   is devoid of the charm of spaceballs   and is even lacking the good   solid dialogue of history of the world    it is   in short   one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks   or anybody else   produce    the plot borrows heavily from the well received kevin costner movie of last year   robin hood   prince of thieves    this is not surprising in and of itself   and could have been used to great comic effect   mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie    mel brooks does not take advantage of this   however   and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air   none of which connect and none of which are explained later on    the movie s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice    cary elwes   of princess bride fame   plays robin of loxley   a man who was captured in the crusades   fighting with king richard    he escapes and   joining with a man named achoo   i am sure you can see the obvious joke     fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard   which has been captured by evil prince john   played by funny comic richard lewis    he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil   sheriff of rottingham      a good adventure plot that is sadly unused    elwes and lewis are both excellent comics   but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating    neither actor has any good words to work with   and the lines simply aren t funny   nor believable    perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone    this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted   and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas   that i really felt like leaving the theatre    much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout   and some left the theatre    chuckles were few and far between   and they mostly dealt with visual jokes   such as an old   beaten up horse from   rent a wreck     then from any dialogue whatsoever    scenes that could have been classics   such as the archery contest   are ruined by poor acting    perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive    the basic plot   that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian   is not witty nor funny    mel brooks as a circumcision giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience   not all jewish   either      the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails    the addition of a blind man who stumbles around   falling off cliffs   walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential   but is also made terribly offensive    the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard    he is well worth waiting for   if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue   excruciating visual humor   old puns   ancient jokes and bad acting    if you can t   don t even bother watching this miserable film    ,-1
 with his successful books and movies   michael crichton is doing well    with early successes with westworld   1973   and coma   1978     and recent films such as jurassic park   1993     his films have been entertaining    however   he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere    this $1-1-1 million mess by good director barry levison   disclosure   is dull   long winded   and a huge disappointment    considering the huge budget   the all star cast   and a story by crichton   sphere is majorly disappointing    the film opens with norman goodman   hoffman     a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors    however   when he arrives   he his told by supervisor barnes   peter coyote   that he is actually investigating an spacecraft    along with goodman is mathematician harry adams   jackson     biologist beth halperin   stone   and ted fielding   liev schrieber      they investigate the spaceship   find a massive sphere inside   meet an alien intelligence called jerry   and basically weird crap happens    unfortunately   something went wrong along the way with sphere    the film starts off entertaining enough   but throughout this very long movie   it just gets sillier and sillier    the film jaunts along from scene to scene   never fully explaining what is going on    the actors and directing don t help   either    hoffman is on autopilot   and almost seems embarrassed   throughout the movie   churning out dull lines   and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie    stone is useless   displaying no emotion   and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman    the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson   who s funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere    but he s hardly in it   and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone    the same goes for peter coyote   who hams it up as the officer   but is then killed off halfway through    the director   barry levinson   who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure   1994   messes up with the drama and the action    the drama scenes are   quite frankly   boring   and the action scenes suffer from overkill   with levison throwing the camera all over the place   much like the godawful speed 2   1997    the writing doesn t help much   either    although crichton is great with plots   he s terrible with dialogue   and practically every line in sphere is a dud    the speech is too simple   i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent    practically every line is just stating the obvious    none of it is smart    also   where the hell did the budget go    the sphere itself is impressive   and there s a few nice special effect shots   but where the $1-1-1 million went is anyone s guess    there s a giant squid attack in the picture   but not once does the audience see the squid   even though the film has a massive budget    i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid   and if handled correctly it probably would    but the whole scene is done badly   and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid    finally   the film has no idea what genre to be    levison can t handle his own plot    it leaps from hokey sci fi   to horror   and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller    and   of course   the film is very much like the abyss   1988     although in it s defense   crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released   and is far superior to this rubbish      it s not all that bad though    the plot is all right   there s a few jump scenes   although nothing very scary   and there s the occasionally interesting bit    but overall   sphere is a big waste of some fine talent   a lot of money   and a potentially good movie    not really worth seeing    overall rating= review by david wilcock  ,-1
 director luis mandoki s last film was the superb   serious 1994 drama   when a man loves a woman     but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture     message in a bottle     which is the worst type of romance   a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up    everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before   and much better   so there s an absence of suspense   and the film ultimately moves at such a very   very deliberate pace   as if it is trying to make great     meaningful   statements and plot developments   that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through       message in a bottle   begins with theresa osborne   robin wright penn     a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune   whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day    inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine   and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and   to her objection   finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper    soon   a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message   and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake   theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks   a boating town in north carolina   to find out the specifics of the message    of course   garrett turns out to be a handsome   rugged man around theresa s age and played by kevin costner    she is immediately charmed by him   but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there   and finds that catherine was garrett s late wife who died a few years earlier    do you think you know where this is headed    most likely you do   and i wouldn t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture s end   the movie has fallen into deep   artificial melodrama that i didn t buy for a second    if there are any 1itive things to say about   message in a bottle     it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman   as garrett s stubborn   but loving father   are far above par to be in such a wasteful     shaggy dog   love story   and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast   and paints chicago as an equally alluring city    meanwhile   costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less than stellar films that he has made recently    it seems that with such bad luck   he wouldn t want to make another movie set near water   but here he is again with one of the main   and most ridiculous   centerpieces set on a storm swept sea    the other actors are all   sadly   wasted   including illeana douglas   an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the   friend   roles   here playing penn s confidante and co worker at the tribune    the first half of   message in a bottle   plays like a hum drum   trite television movie for the lifetime channel   as theresa spends a great deal of time   getting to know   garrett   with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining    usually   i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships   but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt   written     and not as if people were really   talking      when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other   and are not particularly interesting themselves   you know immediately that you are in trouble    i swear that while watching   message in a bottle     i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater   heck   in actuality i m not even familiar to the novel this is based on   by nicholas sparks      always one step ahead of the characters   the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried and true hollywood melodrama   the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing    nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa s secret   and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after    this same exact problem occurred in last year s very   very similar   watch this   and you will realize just how similar i mean   meg ryan nicolas cage romantic drama     city of angels      although theresa is deeply touched by the   heartfelt   letter that she finds in the bottle   perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own   preferably before filming began    it should have read     memo to screenwriters   use you brain !    ,-1
 i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago    i guess my memory really sucks    there is very   very little that is funny in caddyshack    the laughs are few   and far between   and what there are really aren t that great    caddyshack   as the name implies   more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club    michael o keefe plays said caddy    why they cast this unknown   fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me    the movie doesn t seem to have a real plot   just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera    the only real story   if you can call it that   was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper   bill murray   who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course    most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera    with painfully limited success    bill murray is slightly amusing in places   but fairly wasted    the biggest waste of all is chevy chase   who didn t even crack a smile on my face with his character s lame zen like approach to golfing    there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight   but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie    i guess that s what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid    i m not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of   but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper    nothing about this movie works    it wouldn t have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn t going to fly    most of the scenes just couldn t 1sibly be funny    it s as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world    i m sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were sup1ed to be funny    in reality   they were painfully embarrassing to watch    there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the   hot babe   of the movie walking by in her bikini    olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl    everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned    maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny    but for the rest of us   stay the hell away from caddyshack    ,-1
 tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse    the fugitive    not quite   this is the plot for double jeopardy   another fugitive copycat without the action   excitement   and good acting that the original had    there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good   this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall   clever huh    oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband   bruce greenwood   who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man    both movies are on video    make the wise choice and pick the fugitive    there are so many flaws in double jeopardy   it is laughable    while serving time in prison   libby parsons   judd   discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice    learning that her husband is still alive   she decides to serve her time in prison   find him   retrieve her son   and kill her husband if necessary    when the strict parole officer travis lehman   jones   stands in her way   libby decides to break the rules   who knows why     and continue her plan   despite the fact that if she gets caught   she s going back to jail    director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son    every other scene   we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture    in an action movie like this   valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something    all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend   i miss my son      nothing more   nothing less    dr   kimble of the fugitive didn t look at one picture of his dead wife   his primary concern was to save himself    libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough    ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this   they will be typecast for the rest of their careers   kind of like their doomed co star tommy lee jones    winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i do my job whether they are innocent or guilty roles    people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right    though i don t think he will win another oscar again    the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons    even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer   the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count    burglary   assault   grand theft auto are some of libby s slipups    the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you re innocent of the major crime    hopefully criminals won t use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent    that would just be plain stupid    ,-1
 while i am not fond of any writer s use of cheap   easy puns   i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it   witness my review of  pecker  from a couple of issues ago      so here goes   the juvenile   college set black comedy  dead man on campus  is dead on arrival    strait laced med student josh   tom everett scott   who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout    s blemish free academic record breaks out into fs   thanks to the influence of his ever partying roommate   cooper   mark paul gosselaar     who introduces josh to the sex  and booze filled nights that come with university life    with the threat of losing an academic scholarship   josh   and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming   cooper     what are two good hearted slackers to do    easy  look for a loophole   which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student s   or students    roommate commits suicide   the surviving student   s   shall receive straight as    so instead of studying   josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there   move him into their dorm room   and drive him to suicide before the semester ends    director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white   working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder   take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper s diabolical plot    until then   the usual boring cliches of college life   booze   sex   more booze   fill the time   which is made to feel longer by  saved by the bell  alumnus gosselaar s sitcom bred mugging    that said   once cohn and company do build some comic momentum   they mishandle it    the introduction of the manic   psychotic cliff   lochlyn munro     a potential roommate for josh and cooper   brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates   paranoid nerd buckley   randy pearlstein   and british death rocker matt   corey page      one wishes that cliff would reappear   but   as they say   be careful what you wish for    not surprisingly   he does resurface   and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose   almost immediately   his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty    the same can be said about all of  dead man on campus     whatever morbid appeal the far fetched premise has quickly evaporates   and the self absorbed characters   especially cooper   pretty much grate from the get go     dead man  doesn t grow tiresome   it already  is  once the clever opening titles are through    as it slogs along to a cheesy   happy for all parties conclusion    dead man  lives up to its title and then some  not only does the movie grow even more tired and die   it still insists on going on        like a zombie    ,-1
 boy   what a great movie ! !  keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together   the director of the fugitive   andrew davis   back again to give us another thriller   and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot    how could this not be a blockbuster    all die hard keanu reeves fans   read on    ol   much ado about nothing   plays eddie kasalivich   a machinist studying at the university of chicago    to help pay for the rent   he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university    by happy coincidence   he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics    this project holds great promise   taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in    a potential solution to the earth s energy problems without the pollution cost    surely nobody could have any problems with that    morgan freeman is paul shannon   the project s sponsor    he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public    he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly    so he murders the project leader   blows up the project   great but short scene here   sort of like a mini id4 city devastation thing   and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi tech hush hush location    unfortunately   our intrepid machinist and an english physicist   weisz   manage to get away and now follows a fugitive like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script    this movie is just dying for a comparison with   the fugitive      both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn t change much   i guess we can t really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere    the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones   chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward    credit to them   but we aren t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters    where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy   eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves  character is never given the time to develop    it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences   which frankly   get quite boring after a while    harrison ford was   the man against the world      he was alone in a world where he didn t know who to trust and it came across real well    in chain reaction   keanu reeves isn t alone    now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia   vulnerability and confusion    we don t get this    we get him thinking he s still in speed   only now our sandra bullock has an english accent   probably doesn t drive a bus   and hardly contributes anything to the movie    the producers here probably thought     hey   what if keanu and rachel don t hit it off too well    let s rope in that morgan to help us out      well   keanu and rachel didn t hit it off well on the screen   and most unfortunately   morgan freeman doesn t help much either    the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder    it s not really his fault    once again   andrew davis just doesn t take the time to build his characters    someone must have convinced him that this time round   cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken    the flying inkpot rating system   * wait for the tv2 broadcast     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    ,-1
 there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling   hapless straight man from the hysterical   naked gun   films   crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he s committed himself to starring in since    the wavering movie spoofs   however   are less forgivable    to be fair     wrongfully accused     the send up in question and nielsen s third parody since the last   gun     isn t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his   dracula   dead and loving it   or   spy hard     which is a mighty good thing    nielsen is still in tip top comedic form   able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns   but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them   and he needs one very soon       wrongfully accused   meshes together the premises of   the fugitive   and   patriot games     casting its always game star as ryan harrison   get it       a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress   kelly le brock      she   however   sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband   michael york     a crime actually committed by a one armed   one legged   one eyed man   aaron pearl      harrison is arrested   found guilty and sentenced to death   but escapes from a prison bus   of course   and then is pursued by a determined u   s   marshal named fergus falls   richard crenna   unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones  already smirky oscar winning role      there s also a mystery brunette   melinda mcgraw   and an assassination subplot involving the u   n   secretary general   but like any of it matters       wrongfully accused   gets off to an assured start   with an in concert nielsen   touted   lord of the violin   by bare chested 1ters   pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo clad mosh in front of the stage    nice touch    most of the scenes that follow   however   never top the opener       hysterical exceptions   the mentos and   baywatch   goofs      movie parodies are crammed in at an almost subliminal rate   but most are empty    when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la   anaconda   or baseball players disappear into a   field of dreams    esque cornfield   there s really nothing to laugh at    other moments   like an interlude in a fishing shop   are so unfocused that you re not sure what you re sup1ed to be laughing at    there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send ups here   so it s 1sible that director/writer pat proft   by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two   guarantees something is sure to stick    and what does stick sticks well   particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard boiled dialogue   what those   naked gun   s   which proft collaborated on   did great   these bits are so on target that they allow you to remember   wrongfully accused   as an almost halfway there spoof instead of a lame brained failure    the movie might have been cursed to begin with   opening fast on the heels of   mafia !     from proft colleague jim abrahams   and   baseketball     from proft colleague david zucker   but it s a strong 1sibility that nobody is going to be accusing   wrongfully accused   of being nielsen s funniest    ,-1
 please don t mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam       i  just want to warn all of y all not to waste your hard earned $$$ on anaconda    it s not even worth a 99 cent video rental    don t listen to ebert on this one   he has no clue what he s talking about !    btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment   she reviews movies for a local paper      now i ll actually back up my huffing and puffing    here goes    movie   anaconda rydain s bottom line   wait for it to come on usa up all night    even then   i doubt it s worth the price of jolt   to help you stay up that late !    why do i hate anaconda    let me count the ways        first of all   this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong    as an ophiophile   snake lover     i can tell you that a   anacondas would never reach a length of 4-1 feet   b   they re scared of people   c   cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake s mouth   and constrictor snakes don t kill what they can t eat   d   people can outrun snakes with no trouble   especially heavy ones like anacondas   e   if an anaconda did eat a human   it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal   therefore it couldn t run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast   and f   snakes have no vocal cords   so they can t make funny squealing noises    whew    i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it    unfortunately   anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel    my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end    anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually    that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn t give up and fall asleep    he was the most likable character in the movie    who wouldn t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman    anaconda did have its cute moments   arguments between ice cube s character and the british guy   for instance    however   those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty eight minutes of boring schlock    the writers had   and blew   a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines    i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny    did she retort with a clever   ego withering comeback    of course not !     i m trying to work !    gee   that s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with    she could have told him to go find a knothole or something           p but i will admit   there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome   hint   it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks      as for the plot   i m still trying to find one    this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous   computer generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster than gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet       harrier snake      not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims    the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist   should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense     in which the sick guy s g friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him    that was about as clear and understandable as mission   im1sible       if someone could explain that movie to me   i d be most grateful !  all the old guy double agents looked the same ! !    i wasn t inspired by the acting   save for the evil dude    i can t blame the actors   though    it s not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with    this concludes rydain s diatribe on a shameless exploitation   and perpetuation !   of public fear of snakes    comments   flames   anyone     rydain the atomic cheese   fresh from chernobyl dairies !  ,-1
 this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be   one of the hottest writers in hollywood      he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream   8/1-1     then added the successful i know what you did last summer   7   5/1-1    script to his mix   and also created the popular tv series   dawson s creek      so when he asked to direct his first movie   based on his first ever script written   everyone and their grandma said   sure   go for it !      uhhm   my question is       did anyone bother reading this stupid script        plot   ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west   mrs   tingle   and set to lose her scholarship to college    when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story   they end up tying her up   and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman    critique   it s not so much that this is a bad movie   than the fact that it sucks    this movie is chock full of one dimensional characters   contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on   zero tension or thrills   plot holes the size of my big ass   lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie   and molly ringwald   vivica a   fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles    i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery   8/1-1   and 9 to 5   but unfortunately for williamson   he went nowhere with the bright foundation   making references to the exorcist and dr    zhivago   which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate    he also forgot about suspense   with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions   unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue    sure   katie holmes is cute   and her co star   marisa coughlan   did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist   worth two points out of my three on ten     but how can we forgive the biggest one dimensional character in any film   holmes  rival in the film   mrs   tingle s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her   are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays     and a transparent romance between holmes and some long haired dude   hired to be the poor man s version of skeet ulrich   who himself is a poor man s version of johnny depp !      all in all   this movie was laughable for me   provided me with no insight into anything   demonstrated williamson s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script   and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into   unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability   humanity or capacity to comprehend    no hip lines   no cheap thrills   just a dull time at the movie theater    if you want to see a funny teenage movie   go see detroit rock city   8/1-1     and thank my drunken   sorry ass in the morning    little known facts about this film and its stars   kevin williamson s father was a fisherman    kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer   7   5/1-1      he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally   so is dawson leery on tv s   dawson s creek     a show kevin created    he was once an aspiring actor    in fact   he even landed a bit part on tv s   another world      also   williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs   tingle   which is also loosely based on the book   killing mr   griffin   by the writer of i know what you did last summer   7   5/1-1      lois duncan    he has also come out and said that he is a gay man    helen mirren was born in london   england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff    she is married to director taylor hackford   whose works include devil s advocate   8/1-1   and an officer and a gentleman   8   5/1-1      this film was originally titled killing mrs    tingle   but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident    actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called   wasteland      this is actor barry watson first full feature film    he has played the character of   seth   on tv s   malibu shores   several times    ,-1
 in a typical cinematic high school   the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them   but not before the boys  scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books    as the sexual acts take place   the other guys hang out nearby   guzzling beer and grunting like pigs    in the rage   carrie 2   robert mandel s terminally bland sequel to carrie   there isn t a single original moment    only amy irving returns from carrie   and the talent of the rest of the sequel s cast is im1sible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu s script    as rachel   the horror story s lead   emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory   but it isn t exactly her fault    the director asks for little from his actors   which is precisely what he gets    sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie   rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open   but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim    her fellow students delight in tormenting her    of course   she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers    as the movie marks time until its big finale   it throws in some repugnant scenes   hoping to turn audience s stomachs    rachel s girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made   love   to her the night before spurns her       he gets major points in his black book for this   but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death      even a helpless puppy is run over   and we see his poor   little body flipping over and over under a truck    the teenagers in the movie are completely blas   about it all       doesn t it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday     asks one of the few kids with a conscience       why      responds his nonplussed girlfriend       she wasn t anybody      remarkably devoid of any energy   especially for a horror flick   the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater s armrest    with material this bad   the film s only hope is to go for parody   but it isn t smart enough to realize it    even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie    the rage   carrie 2 runs 1   45    it is rated r for graphic violence   teen alcohol abuse   sex   nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers    ,-1
 man   this was one wierd movie    similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn t decide which genre it is    the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone   which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship    the last half hour    this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided     screw it   let s just kill everybody      from then on   forget sci fi       this  movie becomes 1-1-1% horror    what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way    instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare   this movie just uses loud noises   sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore           yawn         everyone s  seen it all before and knows when to expect it    the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew    there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed   but what did this    then finally after being painfully restored   the new crew views the video    the acting isn t too bad at all           considering what the actors had to work with anyway   as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of    there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though   like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space    this movie could have been so much better    it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with    there was just nothing new here that any of us haven t seen before in aliens or hellraiser    ,-1
 the king and i   a warner brothers animated   musical feature   recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king   with obvious results    when anna   miranda richardson     a british schoolteacher   travels to saim to educate the king s   martin vidnovic   children   she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly   and must say something to the greedy ruler    meanwhile   the king s prime minister   ian richardson     the stereotypical villain   plots to overthrow the king   taking the throne    the last   and most predictable   main subplot deals with the king s son   allen d   hong     and his love for a servant   tuptim   armi arabe     and how he conflicts with his feelings   and the ancient laws of saim    not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent   as the king and i s problems could fill the blank pages of a journal    i will only note the major difficulties   for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail    the screenplay   written by arthur rankin   peter bakalian   jacqeline feather   and david seidler   which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein   has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory   as every time the obnoxious king would shout     etc   etc   etc     i would cringe    literally    speaking of cringing  i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film   which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking    besides the repetitive dialogue from the king   on the whole   the songs seem out of place   and unlike the lyrics   are unmagical    the sole song which is used cleverly is   getting to know you     which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors   which they have never been ex1ed to    unlike disney animated features   the king and i s songs don t add to the film   and are as uneffective as could be    take the following scenario as an example   as the sheer horror of the king and i s music is at its worst    you re being hunted by a dragon !  what do you do !    sing a happy song !  martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion  you hear the saying two -1atives don t make a 1itive    believe it !  with the terrible dialogue that the king has   along with his awful voice track   the king is completely unbelievable   only shows mild signs of any personality   and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says   etc     etc     etc       more and more as the film progresses    no personality at the beginning of the movie   none at the end    and where does this character s personality change    hey   i thought anna was sup1ed to change him !  isn t that the whole plot    the prime minister s hideous sidekick   darrell hammond   brings his share of cringes as well   oh no !  another one of his teeth fell out !  hardy har har !  he is sup1ed to bring laughs for the kidlets   but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him    by the way this review is going   you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films  hence why i hate this movie   because the king and i is a disgrace to animation    animated films   such as 1994 s the lion king and 1998 s the prince of egypt   are among my favorite movies of all time    the animation team does design their share of well animated settings   so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king   until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds    i have not read the play   or seen the oscar winning   1956 film adaption   but from what i can tell   the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play   for the king and i is never magical   nor interesting    if it wasn t for miranda richardson   who voices anna with feeling   the king and i could earn the title     worst movie of the decade      instead   the king and i will just go down as among the year s worst    the bottom line  avoid this movie at all costs    not even young children   the target audience in this film   will enjoy it    not the slightest bit    ,-1
 synopsis   cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion    reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy style   ayla grows up to become a blond   feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate    comments   allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies    she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci fi classic blade runner    the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point   the 1ter art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title    not even her starring role in this turkey   unfortunately   can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese    it s so uniquely bad   a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries   and miserably fails   to be serious   that it s oddly fascinating    the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed   wanting to see how this dud plays out    the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m   auel    to this day   the book 1sesses a loyal cult following    i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother    i have never read this book   but i sure hope it s 1-1   -1-1-1 times better than its film adaptation    if not   then i m at a complete loss to explain its popularity    the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene    a young ayla   looking much like drew barrymore in e   t      tramps about in the woods    with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her   the audience s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered    what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla s mother   a blonde with fur pants       er    leggings      tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera       well    as the earthquake slowly recedes    a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch   but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven    i won t detail the story any further   this seems enough to illustrate my point    this movie is really stupid    it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief    also   the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston    the movie doesn t just suggest this message   it whacks the message into the audience with a two by four    a blond   gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs    she s of the   new people     they re of the   old people   with   the memories      yep    we get it    we get it    the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up   which surprises me    the movie depends upon a lot of make up obviously   but much of it is unconvincing    as stated before   daryl hannah is daryl hannah here   she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time    the rest of the characters have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt    the face painting that s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind    this movie also suffers from its new age trappings    maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985   but now it sounds dated and cliched   like poorly conceived elevator music    add to this the film s faux mysticism   including spirit animals and dream visions   and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you d expect to hear on a 1 9-1-1 number   and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious    the clan of the cave bear is rated r   though it s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i ve seen in quite a while    it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity    the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes    the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear    the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about    although this may sound gratuitous   i m sure   it s so cheesy that it probably won t bother most people    the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie    however   as i wrote at the beginning of this review   it does have the distinction of originality    typically when i think of bottom of the barrel films dealing with early man   fantasy movies involving dinosaurs   who did not exist at the same time as man   and raquel welch come to mind    the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that   though it s so bad   the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie   which is why i awarded this turkey two stars      i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version   however   i m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie    i shudder to think that it could be otherwise        ,-1
 salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets    actors who demand such salaries might be greedy   but in some instances they are quite justified   because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation    proof for that can be found even in the realm of low budget movies   and one fine example is breakaway   1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring   in   famous figure skater tonya harding    face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie s 1ter   but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra   attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster    one day she decides to retire   but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that    realising that her life suddenly became worthless   myra starts running for her life   followed by professional assassins    terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater    although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities   her acting leaves much to be desired    on the other hand   her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality   believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b films a bad name    martin sheen s brother joe estevez   whose character looks like he had entered from another movies  set   is the only bright spot of breakaway    unfortunately   he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding s silver screen debut proved to be her last film    ,-1
 movies like six days   seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford   anne heche   and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents      the script was written by michael browning   and he decided that   instead of thinking up new ideas   he d rehash a lot of cliches   omit even the slightest bit of character development   and then throw in drug dealing pirates to provide for a few high level action sequences and explosions      there are good scripts out there that high profile actors can make   see the truman show   for instance        six days   seven nights is simply a waste    let s see            we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island      so   how do we do that      well   we ll make her a feisty magazine editor   and we ll make him a crusty old pilot      but wait   she has to have a fianc   e   that can be david schwimmer      but wait   if she has a fianc   e   how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone      i know !    they ll get to their vacation spot   and then she ll get called back !    yessssss !    so   they ll crash on the island   and that will be funny for about five minutes      shucks    oh   i ve got it !    we ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc   e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo   and then he can feel guilty      then   when anne heche kisses harrison ford   they have to kiss   because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie     it will be a vindicated action   because her fianc   e will already have cheated on her !    then   for no obvious reason   they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them      oh   yes !    i feel so good about this story      instead of using characterization to propel the events   it will be completely random   and yet totally predictable !    imagine that    don t get me wrong    six days   seven nights is not a boring picture   ford and heche both do a great job      the sparks fly between them   and so most of browning s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors  sheer force of talent       almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen   and i found myself laughing pretty hard      schwimmer is also funny   and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get      and reitman   who has made some good films   at least tries to make things exciting      even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb   i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences    it s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces      the picture feels like it s been hacked to pieces    i wouldn t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely      the ones that are here are as bad as they come   i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships     and i d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream     why did you pick this awful script !        the film is outright stupid   but some of the elements are subtly horrifying      for instance   take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo   and then feels really guilty      this is a serious problem in real life   but six days   seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device     his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford      in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety   i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story    this is summer movie season   but that doesn t mean our movies have to be dumb      1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters      when i was in line for six days   seven nights   i heard the woman in front of me ask for   two tickets to that new harrison ford movie         why didn t she know the name of the film      i sup1e she just didn t care       what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big budget pictures don t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves      good actors should sign to good scripts   and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash   they least they could do is assume that we d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents    ,-1
 if anything     stigmata   should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close to one another    of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year   it is clearly the worst    i sup1e i should have seen this coming    after all     blair witch   thoroughly creeped me out     sixth sense   was mildly spooky   and then   stir of echoes   had its moments   but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over    clearly   the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping    is it then any surprise that   stigmata   is the dullest   most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe i have seen in a long while    no   not really    patricia arquette plays frankie page   a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe trotting mother    as it turns out   the rosary belonged to a recently deceased brazilian priest    the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan   gabriel byrne   because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue    father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving sup1ed religious signs   but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue    his investigation is soon called off   however   when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata   in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ    father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie  s story   considering she s an atheist   but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself   he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on    he eventually begins to suspect that his boss   cardinal houseman   jonathan pryce     is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church    as it turns out   the dead priest had been working on the translation of a   fifth gospel   before they were excommunicated    the new rupert wainwright music video            i mean film   stigmata   is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse    indeed   it would have been good if it were a music video   because it s only interesting for about five minutes    i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion   double ex1ure   and extreme close ups   whoaaaaaa ! ! ! !     other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and   yes   he has been to film school    his camera trickery is interesting for a little while   but eventually   it becomes headache inducing    what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue   such as it is     with wainwright screaming at the audience     see    look at what i can do !  i m an ex cellent dir ect or      maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow motion shots of water dripping in reverse   or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying   ooh   scary !      if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery   i didn t see it    just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story   here comes a double ex1ure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever    arrrrrrrghhhh            then again   the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if   stigmata   had a story or characters that were remotely engaging    though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help   he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script    where are plot continuity and character development when you need them    case in point   frankie page is the character that   i assume   we are sup1ed to identify and sympathize with   but we aren t given any back story on her character   or any reason to like her    the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard working hairdresser   who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building   and she s kind of cute   so let s start the bleeding !  the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help   either    according to frankie page   what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back    go clubbing !  sure   that makes sense    arquette   byrne   and pryce give it the old college try   but their characters are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking    scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably sup1ed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat   because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable    even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eyes   she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon    even more curiously   he seems to be interested in her advances    father andrew s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic    as for pryce   he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle     i ll get you   my pretty     for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded    trust me   i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain    what s worse   after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats   we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction   veers off in another   then another   and ends up being totally incomprehensible    first of all   the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details   how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary    how come an atheist like her was chosen   since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata    actually   i m not sure what frankie was 1essed by    sup1edly   stigmata occurs when one is 1essed by the holy spirit   but the film later has her being 1essed by the dead priest   and later by some evil spirit   i think      which one is it    the answer to this question   of course   is very simple   the 1sessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr   wainwright wants to use this time    furthermore   the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap up   and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church    if you do any research at all about the gospel of st   thomas   you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church   as the film seems to claim     but that it is readily available at your local library    there s nothing the catholics need to worry about   though       stigmata s   religion is so off base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church    if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters   they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns   which would have been far more interesting    i m not catholic   in fact   i don  t care much for the catholic church   but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means    it s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as   stigmata   does    it  s not thought provoking   though it would like to be   and it is definitely not scary   though it pretends to be    i m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film   because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story    maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever    the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over   and over   and over    like so many films of the mtv generation   this one suffers from overkill    so much is overdone in   stigmata     that it eventually has no effect on the audience   leaving us to pick out the film s   many   flaws    i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st   thomas is so earth shattering    when we finally hear it   the saying sounds like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school   which means that for all its flash   the whole film is really much ado about nothing    the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog   and   stigmata   is it    ,-1
 john boorman s   zardoz   is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own    not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d   wood jr   has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time    of course   wood s career can be explained by two things   he had no money and he had no talent    boorman   on the other hand   cannot court such excuses to explain   zardoz     or his follow up film   the equally awful   exorcist ii   the heretic        boorman obviously had a sizable budget   a matinee idol movie star   sean connery   in the lead role   and although you wouldn t know it from this film   boorman does indeed have talent    this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece   deliverance     1972     as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama   hope and glory     1987     the slightly over conceived arthurian epic   excalibur     1981   and the father son jungle adventure   the emerald forest     1985      his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination   but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste    if boorman is anything   he s ambitious   and when he succeeds   it s in grand fashion    unfortunately   the bigger they are   the harder they fall   and when boorman falls   the resounding impact can be heard for miles around       zardoz   is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies   an obsession of boorman s    his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even   the wizard of oz     a book which figures into the movie s plot    but   despite all this reaching   the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling    the events take place in the distant year 2293   but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found    in fact   things seems to have moved backwards   with people riding horses   shooting old style guns   and living in large victorian mansions    it s more middle ages than space age    the world of   zardoz   is divided into two distinct hemispheres   the outlands   where all the poor   pathetic people live   and the vortex   where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life    these immortals never grow old   they never engage in sexual activity   they 1sess psychological powers   and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal   and everyone contributes equally to the society    however   if one breaks the rules   that person is punished by being aged so many years    if someone breaks the rules enough   he or she is aged to the point of senility   and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals    one of the immortals   arthur frayn   niall buggy     a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face   is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed    like   the wizard of oz     he adopts a god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head       this flying head is one of the movie s opening images   and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come      calling himself zardoz   frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators   whose pur1e is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can t procreate and take up more resources    from inside his giant   stone head   zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like     the gun is good    the penis is evil      that line alone is worth the movie s cult following    one day   an exterminator named zed   sean connery     sneaks into zardoz s flying stone   pushes frayn out   and goes back to the vortex    once there   the immortals label him a   brutal   and study him like a lab rat   taking great   perverse care in exploring his sexuality   which is a mystery to them    they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection   and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up    i say   hilarious   because that is exactly what   zardoz   is    it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so   he made this film with the straightest of faces   although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward   he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming    just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles   he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper   a mane of hair braided halfway down his back   a wyatt earp style handlebar mustache   and a pair of thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker    boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of   deliverance     which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green light this effort    he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera   including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth     2-1-11       whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in   zardoz   besides the inadvertent humor    sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971   and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace    he got exactly that in   zardoz     and it s a wonder it didn t end his career    i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements    is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life    is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing    or is it a social statement   something about the inherent -1ativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates    karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary    come to think of it   maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip    people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy    ,-1
 the kids in the hall are an acquired taste    it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer    maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies   they would grow into the big screen    my recommendation is that   unless you are a big fan of the kids   skip the film    as it is   their first  and most likely only  attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv    a big budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show    the kids go through the motions   but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so    and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics    brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression    in typical sketch comedy tradition   each actor plays several roles    doctor cooper   kevin mcdonald   and his team create the drug    then   under pressure from don roritor   mark mckinney     founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals   dr   cooper releases the drug into the marketplace    the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film    at about 9-1 minutes   brain candy still seems long    the best thing about sketch comedy  and the kids are no exception  is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs   then go on to another quick skit    but with the additional set up necessary in telling a longer   coherent story   the laughs just dont come fast enough    strangely   the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv    the movie makes several attempts at risqueness  mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters  but they seem almost forced   as if they have to live up to a pg rating    one of the best bits   though   does make use of thompsons naked buttocks   we see him charging into battle  going to have sex with some guys taking a shower    in the classic of this genre   monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail    the kids   unfortunately   are not up to the task    there are some amusing moments   to be sure   but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one    ,-1
 there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director    of course   his best film was 1978 s masterpiece     halloween     but he also made 198-1 s   the fog     and 1987 s underrated     prince of darkness      heck   he even made a good film in 1995   with   in the mouth of madness      but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992   with the terrible comedy     memoirs of an invisible man      somehow   carpenter has lost his touch   with junk like his failed 1995 remake of     village of the damned     to his uninspired 1996 sequel     escape from l   a     those movies   however   look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film     john carpenter s vampires      if i was him   i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title    it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as     vampires      the story is simple    jack crow   james woods   is a vampire hunter who   along with one of his partners   montoya   daniel baldwin     and a prostitute   katrina   sheryl lee     survives an attack from the master vampire   valek   thomas ian griffith      since katrina was previously bitten by him   crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later   and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her    it seems valek s mission is to steal a black   wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him    my question is   how many time have we seen this same story played out    well   the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made       john carpenter s vampires     sadly enough   is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen    in fact   there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 1-15 minute running time    the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed   without any interesting camera work   which is usually a trademark of carpenter s    and then we come to the screenplay   which   as far as i can tell   is nearly non existent    there is no story development   and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters    james woods can be a good actor   but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of   pseudo    clever lines of dialogue    daniel baldwin has some potential   but his character comes off as being very dense    and sheryl lee   faring much better as laura palmer in   twin peaks       like all of the female characters   plays an offensive stereotypical whore    there is not an ounce of intelligence   or excitement in     john carpenter s vamires     which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s    he has said that he turned down directing     halloween   h2-1     because he couldn t work up any excitement for it    and yet   when asked about a   vampires   sequel   he said he would be happy to do it    i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent   not to mention a significant number of iq points    ,-1
 two party guys bob their heads to haddaway s dance hit   what is love      while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub    it s barely enough to sustain a three minute  saturday night live  skit   but  snl  producer lorne michaels    clueless  creator amy heckerling   and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution s recurring   roxbury guys   sketch that would presumably make a good feature    emphasis on the word   presumably       a night at the roxbury  takes an already thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point  and that of viewers  patience levels    the first five minutes or so of  roxbury  play very much like one of the original   roxbury guys   skits    with   what is love      blaring on the soundtrack   the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi   chris kattan and will ferrell   bob their heads   scope out   hotties   at clubs   and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts    there is one crucial difference   however  these guys speak    that little fact has been used as justification for the film s existence   that the butabis  newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters    the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren   ferrell   and kattan are new   that s for sure   but they all lead to comic dead ends    there is no story per se   only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots    the brothers literally run into   or   rather   get run into   as in by car   richard grieco of  21 jump street  fame   and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club    there   they meet a hotshot club owner   chazz palminteri   conspicuously uncredited  can you blame him       who takes an interest in an idea of theirs    meanwhile   the bros  overbearing father   dan hedaya   wants them to stop clubbing    when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father   a rift is created between the two    the narrative messiness of  roxbury  would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny   but virtually none of it is    the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film   with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end    alas   the joke  a rather lazy takeoff on  jerry maguire   will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film    granted   a lot of people  have  seen  jerry maguire    but the fact that the film s best joke is completely dependent on one s familiarity with another film says a lot about  roxbury  s lack of inspiration    that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves    like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of  saturday night live      the roxbury guys   is a one joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context    after watching one of the   roxbury   skits on snl   this is what you come away with from the characters   they bob their heads to   what is love        bump unsuspecting women   and       that s all    after watching  a night at the roxbury    you ll be left with exactly the same    ,-1
